  <H2>Retirement</H2>
  In retirement I've been doing more of a variety of things, including
  <ul>
  <li> some category theory proofs in Coq
  <li> reverting to my earlier interest in the law, 
    including being rather outspoken
  about legal issues and cases that attract my interest, see further

  </ul>
