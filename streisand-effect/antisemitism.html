  <H1>Accusations of antisemitism</H1>
<p>
Here we list instances of people being accused of antisemitism,
with the likely intention to silence them, where they have in fact been
"guilty" only of criticism of Israel.
</p> <p>
The difference between antisemitism and criticism of Israel should be clear
enough, but can perhaps be best illustrated by articles such as
<ul> <li>
<a href =
https://www.theage.com.au/national/as-jews-we-don-t-accept-that-criticism-of-israel-s-government-is-antisemitic-20240201-p5f1o6.html
>As Jews, we don’t accept that criticism of Israel’s government is antisemitic
by Sarah Schwartz and Max Elliott Kaiser</a>
</li> <li>
<a href = https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/how-jews-can-support-palestinian-rights-condemn-antisemitism-ncna1268680
>Supporting Palestinian rights is antisemitic because Israel wants it to be,
by Abraham Gutman</a>
</li> <li>
a <a href = https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/2018/07/17/first-ever-40-jewish-groups-worldwide-oppose-equating-antisemitism-with-criticism-of-israel/
>statement from 40+ Jewish groups</a> saying
<blockquote>
At times like this, it is more important than ever to distinguish between
the hostility to or prejudice against Jews on the one hand and legitimate
critiques of Israeli policies and system of injustice on the other.
<br>...<br>
We urge our governments, municipalities, universities and other institutions to
reject the IHRA definition [see below] ... <br>
Israel does not represent us and cannot speak for us when committing
crimes against Palestinians
</blockquote>
</li> </ul>
</p> <p>
Often, though, people don't get this (or pretend not to). 
For example, this article, originally headed <a href =
https://www.thejc.com/opinion/if-you-support-the-palestinian-cause-in-any-form-youre-facilitating-jew-hate-shyhqy05
>If you support the Palestinian cause in any form, you’re facilitating
Jew-hate</a>, by Melanie Phillips.
(For an account of how it has been changed, see 
<a href = 
https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250102-jewish-chronicle-under-fire-over-article-claiming-palestinian-solidarity-is-anti-semitic/
>here</a>.)
So here is a reality check: the Israel government is facilitating Israeli-hate,
and the more <i>you</i> push the narrative identifying Jew with Israeli,
the more <i>you</i> facilitate this being translated to Jew-hate.
</p> <p>
Another article by the same author is <a href =
https://www.thejc.com/opinion/dont-fall-for-bogus-claims-of-islamophobia-qsvwxvnt
>Don’t fall for bogus claims of ‘Islamophobia’</a>, which contains such gems as
'The concept of “Islamophobia” is thus profoundly anti-Jew'.

So why am I linking to these articles, when I think they are completely
bonkers?  Well, it is to encourage you to not to be fooled by anyone who says
commentary or opinions about Israel/Palestine is antisemitic.
</p> <p>
Other cases of the same phenomenon:
<ul> <li>
An organisation in the USA tracking incidents of anti-semitism <a href =
https://newrepublic.com/post/177993/adl-abandons-pretense-tracking-antisemitism-honestly-palestine-rallies
>now includes pro-Palestine marches in its count of antisemitic incidents</a>
</li> <li>
Australia's "Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism"
made a <a href = 
https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=74878e42-2c56-4517-9b1e-cfa7a30ec76c&subId=763089
>submission to a Senate Inquiry about Antisemitism</a>.
The submission repeatedly refers to "antisemitic or anti-Israel ..." -
apparently acknowledging that they are different - although the context
often suggests the opposite, and of course anti-Israel discourse is 
neither part of her job nor part of the subject of the Inquiry. 
In part of the submission which collects individual experiences, many are about
Israel, not about Jews - <a href =

quotes and discusses a deranged tweet to the effect that Jewish critics of
Israel's genocide are "vicious antisemites".
</li> </ul>
</p>

<H2>The IHRA definition of antisemitism</H2>
<p>
The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance provided a so-called <a href =

>Definition of Antisemitism</a>.
It has been trenchantly criticised by several leading lawyers:

>How the IHRA's anti-Semitism definition is a threat to British democracy,
by Richard Silverstein</a>
</li> </ul>
</p> <p>
Let me add to these some briefer comments of my own.
Here is the "definition", with <i>my emphases</i> and
[my interpolations or comments]
<blockquote>
Antisemitism is a <i>certain</i> perception of Jews,
which <i>may</i> [or may not] be expressed as hatred toward Jews
[and presumably, may or may not be expressed otherwise].
</blockquote>
So what have we learnt about it so far?  Only that it is something to do with
attitudes antagonistic to Jews,
which is more than what we get from the second sentence,
which I won't bother to quote.
</p> <p>
Then follows a section about examples.  With a prefatory paragraph
<blockquote>
Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel
[that is what this is really all about]
conceived as a Jewish collectivity [not sure what that means].
</blockquote>
The rest of that paragraph is probably uncontroversial.
Then it goes on to more specific examples, introduced by this text
<blockquote>
Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools,
the workplace, and in the religious sphere <i>could,
taking into account the overall context</i>, include,
<i>but are not limited to</i>
</blockquote>
That is, the 11 examples following may or may not be examples of antisemitism
and anything else may or may not be an example of antisemitism.
And that's it.
</p> <p>
In fact this rather reminds me of the sentence I found once on
<a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasang >Wikipedia</a>,
"The parasang <i>may</i> have originally been <i>some</i> fraction of the
distance an infantryman could march in <i>some</i> predefined period of time."
</p> <p>
But when organisations have adopted, or been pressured to adopt,
the IHRA definitions, <i>including all the examples</i>
(eg see <a href =
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-anti-semitism-jewish-jeremy-corbyn-policy-a8450346.html
>here</a>) (one assumes they ignore the fact that the examples
may or may not be examples of antisemitism), it is
pertinent to look at those examples.
Strikingly, the majority of them mention Israel,
and some of these don't even refer to Jewish people.
Which gives an idea of the concerns of those who framed it.
</p> <p>
The weirdest one, to me, is the 7th example:
<blockquote>
Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination,
e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.
</blockquote>
A "right to self-determination" sounds nice, but give it a moment's thought.
Does any similarly identifiable group have such a right?  (Or should it?)
How about the Sikhs, or the Sinhalese, or the Tamils in Sri Lanka,
all Tamils? 
And what does having a "right to self-determination" mean anyway?
Does it mean
<ul> <li>
entitlement to choose an area of land and make it their own?
</li> <li>
and to expel the existing inhabitants?
</li> <li>
and to discriminate against the remaining existing inhabitants?
</li> <li>
or to discriminate among its inhabitants on racial/religious grounds?
(not doing so being something expected or demanded of other democratic nations
- see the 8th example).
</li> </ul>
And if I say none of these groups should have a "right to self-determination",
does that show prejudice against Sikhs, or Sinhalese, or Tamils?
Or just Jews?
</p> <p>
And then, coming to the second half of that example,
why is criticising Israel as racist (even if such criticism were knowingly
wrong, and thereby suggestive of anti-<i>Israel</i> prejudice)
anything to do with a "right to self-determination"?
See this article, <a href =
https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/antisemitisim-jews-israel-labour-party-bds-jewish-coalition-palestine-a8458601.html
>As Jews, we reject the myth that it's antisemitic to call Israel racist</a>.

</p> <p>
The IHRA definition has been defended against criticism, sometimes along the
lines of "it has no legal effect", and/or "it doesn't actually define
anything to be antisemitic".  Unfortunately it has been used as though it does.
Here is a long report by the
European Legal Support Center and British Society for Middle Eastern Studies,
<a href =
https://www.brismes.ac.uk/files/documents/brismes-elsc-joint-report-ihra.pdf
>The Adverse Impact of the IHRA Definition of Antisemitism</a> in
UK Higher Education, where universities were <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/uk-antisemitism-universities-ihra-definition-ultimatom-stand-firm
> pressured by the UK Government</a>
to "adopt" (whatever that means) the "definition".
</p> <p>
And here is an article discussing the text of the definition and its usage,

<H2>Other definitions of antisemitism</H2>
Meanwhile, here are some other definitions of antisemitism, which aren't
focussed on discouraging criticism of Israel.
<ul> <li>
<a href = https://jerusalemdeclaration.org >

A short definition
<blockquote>
Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against
Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish)
