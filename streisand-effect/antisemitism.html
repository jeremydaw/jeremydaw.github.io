  <H1>Accusations of antisemitism</H1>
<p>
Here we list instances of people being accused of antisemitism,
with the likely intention to silence them, where they have in fact been
"guilty" only of criticism of Israel.
</p> <p>
The difference between antisemitism and criticism of Israel should be clear
enough, but can perhaps be best illustrated by articles such as
<ul> <li>
<a href =

a <a href = https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/2018/07/17/first-ever-40-jewish-groups-worldwide-oppose-equating-antisemitism-with-criticism-of-israel/
>statement from 40+ Jewish groups</a> saying
<blockquote>
At times like this, it is more important than ever to distinguish between
the hostility to or prejudice against Jews on the one hand and legitimate
critiques of Israeli policies and system of injustice on the other.
<br>...<br>
We urge our governments, municipalities, universities and other institutions to
reject the IHRA definition [see below] ... <br>
Israel does not represent us and cannot speak for us when committing
crimes against Palestinians
</blockquote>
</li> <li>
A recent <a href =
https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/FCA/2025/720.html
>judgment of the Federal Court of Australia</a>, whose summary says
<blockquote>
The Court has found that the impugned passages in the interview and
the sermon say critical and disparaging things about the actions of
Israel and in particular the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza and about
Zionists, but that the ordinary, reasonable listener would not understand
those things to be about Jewish people in general. That person would
understand that not all Jews are Zionists and that disparagement of
Zionism constitutes disparagement of a philosophy or ideology and not
a race or ethnic group. Also, political criticism of Israel, however
inflammatory or adversarial, is not by its nature criticism of Jews in
general or based on Jewish racial or ethnic identity. The conclusion
that it is not antisemitic to criticise Israel is the corollary of the
conclusion that to blame Jews for the actions of Israel is antisemitic;
the one flows from the other.
</blockquote>
(see further paragraphs 107 and following in the judgment).
<br>(also discussed in <a href =
https://www.deepcutnews.com/p/landmark-court-rulings-reveal-limits
>Landmark court rulings reveal limits of pro-Israel lobby</a>)
</li> </ul>
</p> <p>
Often, though, people don't get this (or pretend not to).
For example, this article, originally headed <a href =
https://www.thejc.com/opinion/if-you-support-the-palestinian-cause-in-any-form-youre-facilitating-jew-hate-shyhqy05
>If you support the Palestinian cause in any form, you’re facilitating
Jew-hate</a>, by Melanie Phillips.
(For an account of how it has been changed, see
<a href =
https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250102-jewish-chronicle-under-fire-over-article-claiming-palestinian-solidarity-is-anti-semitic/
>here</a>.)
So here is a reality check for her: the Israel government is facilitating
Israeli-hate, and the more <i>you</i> push the narrative identifying Jew with
Israeli, the more <i>you</i> facilitate this being translated to Jew-hate.
</p> <p>
Another article by the same author is <a href =
https://www.thejc.com/opinion/dont-fall-for-bogus-claims-of-islamophobia-qsvwxvnt
>Don’t fall for bogus claims of ‘Islamophobia’</a>, which contains such gems as
'The concept of “Islamophobia” is thus profoundly anti-Jew'.

So why am I linking to these articles, when I think they are completely
bonkers?  Well, it is to encourage you to not to be fooled by anyone who says
commentary or opinions about Israel/Palestine is antisemitic.
</p> <p>
Meanwhile you would be excused for assuming this article is satire:
<a href = Bake sales for Gaza could stoke Jew hatred, EU warns >
Bake sales for Gaza could stoke Jew hatred, EU warns</a> - well, it's not.
It goes on
<blockquote>
Fundraisers for Gaza make ‘Jews feel uncomfortable’,
says Europe’s anti-Semitism tsar.
<br>...<br>
She’s hostile to any sign of solidarity with the Palestinians,
calling it ‘ambient anti-Semitism’

Other cases of the same phenomenon:
<ul> <li>
Australia's "Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism"
made a <a href =

>submission to a Senate Inquiry about Antisemitism</a>.
The submission repeatedly refers to "antisemitic or anti-Israel ..." -
apparently acknowledging that they are different - although the context
often suggests the opposite, and of course anti-Israel discourse is
neither part of her job nor part of the subject of the Inquiry.
In part of the submission which collects individual experiences, many are about
Israel, not about Jews - <a href =

>J’accuse!… the Jew who accuses his fellow Jews of being antisemites</a>
quotes and discusses a deranged tweet to the effect that Jewish critics of
Israel's genocide are "vicious antisemites".
</li> <li>
The weirdly-named Anti-Defamation League openly counts anti-Zionist events
and rhetoric as antisemitic, see <a href =

<!-- also https://consortiumnews.com/2024/01/11/adl-deems-pro-palestine-protests-anti-semitic/ -->
This of course makes data on antisemitism collected by such organisations
worthless, see <a href =

>here</a> (which refers to counting "rallies that featured antisemitic,

by Anthony Lerman.  Lerman is also quoted <a href =
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism >here</a> saying
<blockquote>
The anti-Zionism equals antisemitism argument drains the word antisemitism
of any useful meaning. For it means that to count as an antisemite, it
is sufficient to hold any view ranging from criticism of the policies
of the current Israeli government to denial that Israel has the right
to exist as a state, without having to subscribe to any of those
things which historians have traditionally regarded as making up an
antisemitic worldview: hatred of Jews per se, belief in a worldwide
Jewish conspiracy, belief that Jews generated communism and control
capitalism, belief that Jews are racially inferior and so on. Moreover,
while theoretically allowing that criticism of Israeli governments is
legitimate, in practice it virtually proscribes any such thing.

</li> <li> <a href =
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/why-the-antisemitism-definition-is-flawed/
>Why the antisemitism definition is flawed</a>, by Prof Geoffrey Alderman
</li> </ul>
</p> <p>
Let me add to these some briefer comments of my own.
Here is the "definition", with <i>my emphases</i> and
[my interpolations or comments]
<blockquote>
Antisemitism is a <i>certain</i> perception of Jews,
which <i>may</i> [or, presumably, may not] be expressed as hatred toward Jews
[and presumably, may or may not be expressed otherwise].
</blockquote>
So what have we learnt about it so far?  Only that it is something to do with
attitudes antagonistic to Jews,
which is more than what we get from the second sentence,
which I won't bother to quote.
As Prof Avi Shlaim says "It fails even to meet the most elementary requirement
of a definition, which is to define." (quoted <a href =
https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2025/1170.html >here, para 97</a>)
</p> <p>
Then follows a section about examples.  With a prefatory paragraph
<blockquote>
Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel
[that is what this is really all about]
conceived as a Jewish collectivity [I'm not sure what that means].
</blockquote>
The rest of that paragraph is probably uncontroversial.
Then it goes on to more specific examples, introduced by this text
<blockquote>
Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools,
the workplace, and in the religious sphere <i>could,
taking into account the overall context</i>, include,
<i>but are not limited to</i>
</blockquote>
That is, the 11 examples following may or may not be examples of antisemitism
and anything else may or may not be an example of antisemitism.
And that's it.  Truly!
</p> <p>
In fact as an example of saying nothing,
this rather reminds me of the sentence I found once on
<a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasang >Wikipedia</a>,
"The parasang <i>may</i> have originally been <i>some</i> fraction of the
distance an infantryman could march in <i>some</i> predefined period of time."
</p> <p>
So what is happening here is that the proponents would counter criticism
by saying "it says only <i>could include</i>, not <i>do include</i>",
but then, when organisations have adopted, or been pressured to adopt,
the IHRA definitions, <i>including all the examples</i>
(eg see <a href =
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-anti-semitism-jewish-jeremy-corbyn-policy-a8450346.html
>here</a>)
they would treat those examples as antisemitic by virtue of the definition.
That is, they ignore the fact that the examples
<i>may or may not</i> be examples of antisemitism.
So it is pertinent to look at those examples.
Strikingly, the majority of them mention Israel,
and some of these don't even refer to Jewish people.
Which gives an idea of the concerns of the definition's proponents.
</p> <p>
The weirdest one, to me, is the 7th example:
<blockquote>
Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination,
e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.
</blockquote>
A "right to self-determination" sounds nice, but give it a moment's thought.
Does any similarly identifiable group have such a right?  (Or should it?)
How about the Sikhs, or the Sinhalese, or the Tamils in Sri Lanka,
or all Tamils?
And what does having a "right to self-determination" mean anyway?
Does it mean
<ul> <li>
entitlement to choose an area of land and make it their own?
</li> <li>
and to expel the existing inhabitants?
</li> <li>
and to discriminate against the remaining existing inhabitants?
</li> <li>
or to discriminate among its inhabitants on racial/religious grounds?
(not doing so being something expected or demanded of other democratic nations
- see the 8th example).
</li> </ul>
And if I say none of these groups should have a "right to self-determination",
does that show prejudice against Sikhs, or Sinhalese, or Tamils?
Or just Jews?
</p> <p>
And then, coming to the second half of that example,
why is criticising Israel as racist (even if such criticism were knowingly
wrong, and thereby suggestive of anti-<i>Israel</i> prejudice)
anything to do with a "right to self-determination"?
See this article, <a href =
https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/antisemitisim-jews-israel-labour-party-bds-jewish-coalition-palestine-a8458601.html
>As Jews, we reject the myth that it's antisemitic to call Israel racist</a>.
</p> <p>
The IHRA definition has been defended against criticism, sometimes along the
lines of "it has no legal effect", and/or "it doesn't actually define
anything to be antisemitic".  Unfortunately it has been used as though it does.
Here is a long report by the
European Legal Support Center and British Society for Middle Eastern Studies,

Antisemitism consists of anti-Jewish beliefs, attitudes, actions or

Jews, hostile behavior directed against Jews (because they are Jews),
and conditions that discriminate against Jews and significantly impede

<H2>Self-hating Jews</H2>
This expression seems like meaningless nonsense - am I a "self-hating
Christian" because I disagree with other Christians on something? -
but it seems to be used of Jews who are critical of Israel.
Anyhow, making a list here of Jewish people or organisations which are
critical of Israel should help to debunk the narrative that there is anything
"antisemitic" about criticising Israel.
Please note that in some cases, I've identified a person as being Jewish
on the basis of (for example), the name, or holding a senior position in the
Israel government, or in an Israeli university, or having written in Hebrew,
etc, so please tell me if I'm wrong - streisandeffect AT substack DOT com.
It's a list which, at 40 entries (March 2025), is longer than I'd ever
imagined it might be, and I'll no doubt keep adding to it.

https://www.jewishnews.co.uk/complaint-lodged-against-barrister-who-tweeted-zionism-is-a-kind-of-racism/
>Complaint lodged against barrister who tweeted ‘Zionism is a kind of

Conveniently the article includes the content of the tweet, as follows:
<blockquote>
“Zionism is a kind of racism. It is essentially colonial. It has
manifested in an apartheid regime calling itself “the Jewish state”
that dominates non-Jews, and particularly Palestinians. You can’t practice
anti-racism at the same time as identifying with, or supporting, Zionism.”
</blockquote>
The article goes on to say
<blockquote>
According to the ... IHRA, a contemporary example of antisemitism <i>is</i> ...

As I've pointed out in detail above, that is not correct: it <i>may be</i> ...

Apparently the <a href =

This article, by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (which had made the
complaint),
<ul> <li>
refers to "<i>the</i> International Definition of Antisemitism" (my emphasis)
(meaning the IHRA definition): it's not <i>the</i> Definition,
it's <i>a</i> Definition (if that - see the discussion above)
</li> <li>
says Magennis's comments were "in breach of" it: not so, it doesn't
<i>forbid</i> anything (and wouldn't do so even if it did actually
<i>define</i> any particular conduct to be antisemitic).

states "According to the ... definition, ...

<h2>Jewish loyalty to Israel??</h2>
<p>
In doing a web search about Dave Smith (see above), I came across this article
<a href = https://www.jfeed.com/antisemitism/uk-antisemitism-poll-rise >
One in Five Britons Found to Be Antisemitic in Shocking New Poll</a>.
It says "... one in five Britons now [affirm] multiple antisemitic statements".
Being the sort of person who would wonder what these (allegedly)
"antisemitic statements" are, I read on.
The article mentions <i>only one</i>, saying "nearly 40% of British adults
now believe that Jews are more loyal to Israel than to Britain".
There is a lot to say about this - here is a sample
<ul> <li>
it's simply a factual statement, either true or false - how can believing
either be a product of prejudice either for or against the group in question?
</li> <li>
granted that to say this (or anything else derogatory about Jews)
publicly without reasonable grounds for believing it may fairly be described
as antisemitic, this is apparently not the case here - in fact a "poll"
presumably asks a yes/no question (we are not told whether there was a
"don't know" option), without the respondent having any opportunity to
try to ascertain whether it was true or not
</li> <li>
in any event, we are not told whether the question was about <i>all</i>
Jews, or <i>some</i> Jews, or not specified; in fact my own belief is:
<i>all</i> Jews - certainly no, <i>some</i> Jews - almost certainly yes
(assuming Britain is no different from Australia - see below)
</li> </ul>
</p> <p>
As a matter of fact the same website has a page <a href =
https://www.jfeed.com/antisemitism >listing articles about "Antisemitism" </a>.
This page will change continually, but right now (17/9/25) more of the
headlines specifically reference Israelis than Jews.
</p> <p>
Anyway, back to the question of Jews being more loyal to Israel than
to their own country: <a href =
https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/24/australian-defence-force-officer-stripped-of-security-clearance-over-loyalty-to-israel-ntwnfb
>Australian defence force officer stripped of security clearance
over loyalty to Israel</a>
The relevant case is <a href =
https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/ARTA/2025/105.html
>HWMW and Director-General of Security [2025] ARTA 105</a>
<!-- also https://jade.io/article/1117433 -->
In the applicant’s <i>own</i> written statement (paragraph numbers
are of the judgment) he said
<ul> <li>
(para 56) Allowing Jews to serve within the ADF must come with an
understanding that the Jew will have a level of loyalty for the Jewish
Nation and for State of Israel.
</li> <li>
(para 58) the vast majority of Jews in Australia, if they do serve in any
national army, serve in the IDF
</li> <li>
(para 58) Judaism mandates the loyalty of a Jew to his people
and to the Land of Israel.
</li> <li>
(para 58) every Jew harbours a varying degree of loyalty to Israel.
</li> <li>
(para 68) inherent level of risk that a Jew, particularly an observant
and learned Jew, will hold a latent level of loyalty for the Jewish Nation
</li> </ul>
(It is made clear that the applicant is Jewish.)  So there we have these
supposedly "antisemitic" statements straight from the horse's mouth.
