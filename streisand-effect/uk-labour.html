  <H1>The Labour party in the UK</H1>
<p>
It seems the Labour party in the UK has been on a rampage of expelling
members (including many Jewish people) for talking about Israel/Palestine,
on the pretext of antisemitism.  See <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/labour-antisemitism-jewish-opponents-israel-targeted
>this article</a> about it, and the YouTube videos, "The Labour Files"
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elp18OvnNV0 >
Episode 1</a>,

Episode 4</a>.
</p> <p>
This article,
<a href = https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1107/dont-apologise-attack/ >
Don’t apologise - attack</a>, suggests that accusations of antisemitism
have also specifically been used to attack Labour's former leader,
Jeremy Corbyn.

<p>
He was <a href =

>expelled</a> from the party in 2017, but this was <a href =

>rescinded</a>
<a href = 
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/machovers-reinstatement-moving-forward/
>(also here)</a>.
</p> <p>
He has given a
<a href = https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/1367/
>long interview</a>.
</p> <p>
In this <a href =
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/a-new-just-jews-video-with-moshe-machover/
><i>Just Jews</i></a> video</a> 
<blockquote>
he says the accusation that the Labour Party is riven with antisemitism
“doesn’t correspond to any evidence that I’ve heard of.”
</blockquote>
</p> <p>
Subsequently, in 2020, he was <a href = 
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/moshe-machover-suspended-again-he-has-issued-a-public-response/
>suspended</a>.
He links to other articles which, he says, "I urge you to read".
Well, that is exactly what this "Streisand Effect" website is about:
I, too, urge you to read them:

And each of the <a href =

relevant ones.

He has also written a lot for the <a href =
