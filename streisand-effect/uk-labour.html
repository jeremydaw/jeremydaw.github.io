  <H1>The Labour party in the UK</H1>
<p>
It seems the Labour party in the UK has been on a rampage of expelling
members (including many Jewish people) for talking about Israel/Palestine,
on the pretext of antisemitism.  See <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/labour-antisemitism-jewish-opponents-israel-targeted
>this article</a> about it, and the YouTube videos, "The Labour Files"
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elp18OvnNV0 >
Episode 1</a>,

Episode 4</a>.
</p> <p>
This article,
<a href = https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1107/dont-apologise-attack/ >
Don’t apologise - attack</a>, suggests that accusations of antisemitism
have also specifically been used to attack Labour's former leader,
Jeremy Corbyn.

<p>
He was <a href =
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/jvl-statement-support-expelled-labour-party-member-moshe-machover/
>expelled</a> from the party in 2017, but this was <a href = 
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/branch-motions-resolutions-expulsion-moshe-machover/
>rescinded</a>
<a href = 
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/machovers-reinstatement-moving-forward/
>(also here)</a>.
</p> <p>
He has given a
<a href = https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/1367/
>long interview</a>.
</p> <p>
In this <a href =
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/a-new-just-jews-video-with-moshe-machover/
><i>Just Jews</i></a> video</a> 
<blockquote>
he says the accusation that the Labour Party is riven with antisemitism
“doesn’t correspond to any evidence that I’ve heard of.”
</blockquote>
</p> <p>
Subsequently, in 2020, he was <a href = 
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/article/moshe-machover-suspended-again-he-has-issued-a-public-response/
>suspended</a>.
He links to other articles which, he says, "I urge you to read".
Well, that is exactly what this "Streisand Effect" website is about:
I, too, urge you to read them:
<ul> <li>
<a href = https://monthlyreview.org/2020/02/01/messianic-zionism/
>Messianic Zionism: The Ass and the Red Heifer</a>
</li> <li>

<a href = http://labourpartymarxists.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/LPM17-web.pdf
>Anti-Zionism does not equal anti-Semitism</a>
</li> </ul>
And each of the <a href = 
https://www.jewishvoiceforlabour.org.uk/ 
>Jewish Voice for Labour</a> articles linked above contains links to other
relevant ones.
</p> <p>
He has also written a lot for the <a href =

>Weekly Worker</a> and the <a href =
