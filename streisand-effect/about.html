<h2>Plans for this blog</h2>
<p>
Nov 2024: At present these are just a set of web pages, written in simple HTML.
I don't want to create them in some format which is peculiar to some
blogging site, which can at any time de-platform anyone for "wrongthink".
They are in hand-coded HTML (which means you can sensibly look at them 
in most browsers by going to "View Source" or something similar),
and that's how I want to keep them permanently.
</p> <p>
I'll probably put this stuff on substack or wordpress or somewhere similar,
if and when I work out how to use it effectively, including importing
raw HTML files (I haven't yet found whether this is possible).
But I do seem to have succeeded in setting up something at
<a href = https://streisandeffect.substack.com/ >
https://streisandeffect.substack.com/</a>,
and an email address streisandeffect@substack.com.
So far I've paid more attention to writing than to working out
how to put it on some blog site, 
especially since what I've written is available, readable,
and hopefully useful just as it is.
</p> <p>
April 2025: This has turned out a bit differently from what I envisaged
initially.  Firstly, there is such a mass of material to write about that
I haven't kept up with the examples I've come across.  Secondly, with
Donald Trump on the loose, that is only going to get worse.
Thirdly, rather than a small number of long articles (which would be
suitable for sending out to a subscriber list), mostly it is a
large number of small entries which I've been adding to a suitable page.
</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
These pages are hosted on github, URL is 
https://github.com/jeremydaw/jeremydaw.github.io.
Which means you can go there and examine the history of changes to the site,
or (if you happen to be familiar with git) clone the site.
