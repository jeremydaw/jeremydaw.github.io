  <H1>Other UK Police actions</H1>
<p>
So many of these!
When you read about them you might think that Britain must be a
wonderfully crime-free society, that the police have time to spend
on trivia like these cases.  
But no.  Persecuting opinions they don't like is clearly more important 
than, for example, bike theft.
Regarding which, 
<a href = https://www.londoncentric.media/p/how-to-catch-a-london-bike-thief >
this article</a> says
<blockquote>
Dunn said he had sympathy with the Met Police's response given their
financial constraints: "You would honestly struggle to put bike theft
quite high up the list when you look at what else happens in society
- rapes, murders, assaults. It obviously and probably should be put
lower down that pecking order."
</blockquote>
Apparently this should now read "when you look at what else happens in society
- rapes, murders, assaults,

commentary on Palestine by those opposed to genocide, ..."
</p><p>
A lot of these actions are based on one of the Terrorism Acts,
or similar legislation.  
I've also written an <a href = ./terrorism.html >
article about this legislation</a>,
in particular about the absurd breadth of the definition of "terrorism".
</p>

<h2>Haim Bresheeth</h2>

Quoting 
<a href = 
https://www.normalisland.co.uk/p/israel-secures-victory-over-the-biggest
>Laura / Normal Island News</a>: <!-- https://archive.vn/ea0G0 -->
<blockquote> <p>
You will be pleased to know British police are taking their role as
enforcers of the Israeli state so seriously that they’ve arrested
a Jewish Israeli academic because he explained Israel is fighting an
unwinnable war. Professor Haim Bresheeth pointed out that British police
have been arresting people for opposing genocide, leaving police with
no choice but to arrest him under the Terrorism Act.
</p><p>
Metropolitan police explained they actually arrested Prof
Bresheeth for “expressing support for a proscribed terrorist
organisation”. Awkwardly, a recording of his speech shows he said no
such thing
</p> </blockquote>

Further discussion by <!-- https://archive.vn/pwOeL -->
<a href = 
https://www.councilestatemedia.uk/p/britain-is-counting-jewish-israeli
>Ricky / Council Estate Media</a>: it is all worth quoting, but in particular
<blockquote> <p>
Either an overzealous police officer overreacted, or more likely, this
was part of a strategy of silencing opposition to genocide.
</p><p>
The officer might as well have said: "I’m arresting you for being
the wrong kind of Jew and having a conscience. We’ll work out the
details later."
</p> </blockquote>

This 
<a href = https://skwawkbox.org/2024/11/03/exclusive-prof-haim-bresheeths-anti-genocide-speech-before-he-was-arrested-for-terrorism/
>Skwawkbox article</a> contains a video of his speech, and says,
accurately, 
<blockquote>
In fact, as a hearing of his speech immediately reveals, rather than
supporting any [proscribed organisation] Bresheeth made the factual
observation that Israel has proven unable to defeat Hamas, Hezbollah
and the Houthis ...  
</blockquote>
<p>
And Skwawkbox also 
<a href = https://skwawkbox.org/2024/11/03/exclusive-video-see-jewish-professors-arrest-by-met-police-for-terrorism-of-condemning-israels-genocide/
>links to a video of the arrest</a>
in which Prof Bresheeth is alleged to have made a "hate speech", 
and that this justifies arrest under the 
<a href = ./terrorism.html >Terrorism Act 2000</a>.
</p><p>
As I've come to expect, this event was hardly covered in the UK mainstream
media. Who did think it was worth covering?
<ul> <li>
<a href = https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/11/4/jewish-academic-arrested-in-uk-over-terrorism-after-gaza-speech

>the Murdoch press here in Australia</a>
</li></ul
</p><p>
Finally, my recommendations for reading/viewing what they don't want you to
see.  Of course there is the video of the speech itself, 
in the Skwawkbox page linked above.
Then, Prof Bresheeth has a 
<a href = https://www.haimbresheeth.com/ >website</a>,
which seems to be more about events 10 and 15 years ago.
</p><p>
It's interesting, though, as a glance at
<a href = https://haimbresheeth.com/gaza/gaza-carnage-archive/
>this part of the site</a> leaves me with the impression that nothing much
has changed since then, except that both sides have cooperated
in ensuring that it is less easy to ignore the conflict.
</p><p>
The various reports associate Prof Bresheeth and/or the meeting at
which he spoke with

>International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network</a>
</li><li>
<a href = https://jewishnetworkforpalestine.uk/

<h2>Natalie Strecker</h2>
She was arrested in Jersey, which seems to have laws similar or identical
to the UK, for inviting support for a proscribed organisation, details
<a href = https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2024/11/16/jep-exclusive-palestine-campaigner-arrested-under-terrorism-law/
>here</a>.
With no details of how she allegedly did this,
the Streisand Effect reading recommendations are a sample of other things
she has said or written, for example

</li></ul>

And here is the link to the 
<a href = https://www.facebook.com/watch/JerseyPSC/ >
Jersey Palestine Solidarity Campaign</a>
which I assume is the organisation which Natalie describes having set up.

<h2>Kit Klarenberg</h2>
<p>
He was detained and questioned, for over 5 hours, under 
<a href = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/3/schedule/3
>Schedule 3</a> of the
Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, 
"for the purpose [allegedly] of determining whether [he]
appears to be a person who is, or has been, engaged in hostile activity".
Schedule 3 seems to be mostly very similar to Schedule 7 of the
Terrorism Act 2000 but to do with "hostile activity" rather than
"terrorism".
</p> <p>
This encounter is described in
<a href =
https://thegrayzone.com/2023/05/30/journalist-kit-klarenberg-british-police-interrogated-grayzone/
>The Grayzone</a>, 
and also
<a href = https://thecradle.co/articles-id/267 >The Cradle</a> and
<a href = https://skwawkbox.org/2023/05/31/uk-police-detain-uk-investigative-journalist-klarenberg-and-grill-him-over-journalism-political-views/
>Skwawkbox</a>
</p> <p>
Of the many publications I wrote for, Kit says,
"their overwhelming, if not exclusive, interest was in The Grayzone."
This makes the Streisand Effect reading recommendation easy, doesn't it?
Do read <a href = https://thegrayzone.com >The Grayzone</a>.
