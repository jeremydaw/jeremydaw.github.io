Here we mention instances of serious bias by established news media.
This category doesn't naturally point you to recommended reading material,
but it may serve to warn against being misled by
<ul> <li>
selective presentation of material,
</li> <li>
choice of language to be sympathetic or unsympathetic to particular causes,
</li> <li>
or failure to fact-check sources which support the case to which they are
sympathetic.
</li> </ul>

I've seen more reported about the BBC than other media outlets.
I don't know if that is because they are worse than the others,
or just because we expect better of them.  Anyway, here goes:

This documentary was shown on the BBC, and at first made available on
BBC iPlayer (a video on demand service), but then withdrawn:

A campaign has sought to discredit the documentary using the
father of 14-year-old Abdullah Al-Yazouri, one of the film’s child
protagonists. Dr Ayman Al-Yazouri served as Gaza’s Deputy Minister of
Agriculture, a civil service role concerned with food production.

I must say, having glanced at it, it seemed weird:
<ul> <li>
it seemed to assume that differences between BBC Arabic and BBC News (English)
were a cause for criticism of the former, not the latter 
</li> <li>
it discussed in detail various incidents of seven, four and nine 
(implied) Israeli civilians being killed, and the way these were covered.
These in mid to late 2024 when, according to all reports, tens of thousands
of civilians in Gaza had been killed

>Top boss at the BBC to leave his job</a>:
two top people at the BBC have resigned, after the BBC was
criticised for the way it edited, or put together,
a speech made by US President Donald Trump 
(apparently it put together two separate bits of a long speech).

>The BBC is in crisis - for all the wrong reasons</a>,
archived <a href = https://archive.vn/XyfGR >here</a>, Owen Jones points out
<blockquote>
The facts are that Donald Trump did incite an insurrection against those
election results. It was completely stupid of Panorama to completely
unnecessarily produce a misleading edit when there was more than enough
evidence to establish this incontrovertible fact. And their misleading
edit did not actually mislead audiences about that basic fact.
</blockquote> <blockquote>
The basic fact is - Trump incited an insurrection which sought to overturn
the presidential election. Panorama did not mislead viewers in the sense
of making them believe he did something he didn’t do.

an article by Jonathan Cook about the BBC and what else it has done far worse,
in which he wrote
<blockquote>
<p>
But Panorama, and the BBC more generally, have been exposed peddling
far worse misinformation. In those cases, there have been precisely no
consequences for such out-in-the-open journalistic abuses.
</p> <p>
The reason heads have rolled at the BBC this time are not because it made
a journalistic blunder – it makes them all the time. It is because the
corporation foolishly offered an open goal to the billionaire right and
its media outlets.
</p> <p>
If anyone is falling for the manufactured “furore” over Panorama’s
latest journalistic gaffe, there are examples of far graver malpractice by
Panorama – especially on issues related to Israel and Palestine. These
editorial crimes have barely caused a ripple, even after they were exposed.
