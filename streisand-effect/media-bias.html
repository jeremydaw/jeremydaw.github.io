  <H1>Media bias</H1>
Here we mention instances of serious bias by established news media.
This category doesn't naturally point you to recommended reading material,
but it may serve to warn against being misled by
<ul> <li>
selective presentation of material,
</li> <li>
choice of language to be sympathetic or unsympathetic to particular causes,
</li> <li>
or failure to fact-check sources which support the case to which they are
sympathetic.
</li> </ul>

<h2>BBC</h2>
<p>
I've seen more reported about the BBC than other media outlets.
I don't know if that is because they are worse than the others, 
or just because we expect better of them.  Anyway, here goes:
</p> <p>
(November 2024): 
<a href = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bbc-israel-gaza-letter-tim-davie-bias-palestine-b2636737.html >
More than 100 BBC staff accuse broadcaster of Israel bias in Gaza coverage</a>,
also reported in 
<a href =
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/2/over-100-staff-accuse-bbc-of-bias-in-its-coverage-of-israels-war-in-gaza >Al Jazeera</a> and
<a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-more-100-staff-accuse-bbc-giving-israel-favourable-coverage-over-gaza-war >Middle East Eye</a>.
And <a href =
https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letters/bbc-bias-israel-gaza-tim-davie-b2639654.html
>here is the letter</a>
</p> <p>
(June 2025): The Centre for Media Monitoring (CfMM)
has put out a report on BBC bias,
<a href = https://cfmm.org.uk/bbc-on-gaza-israel-one-story-double-standards/
>BBC On Gaza-Israel: One Story, Double Standards</a>
with a link to the report <a href =
https://cfmm.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CfMM-report-2023-24-ePDF-Edited.pdf
>here</a>.
Two articles in Middle East Eye: <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/bbc-coverage-israels-war-gaza-systematically-biased-against-palestinians
>BBC coverage of Israel's war on Gaza 'systematically biased against
Palestinians'</a> and <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/uk-gaza-war-bbc-sanitises-israels-genocide-how
>War on Gaza: How the BBC sanitises Israel's genocide</a>
</p> <p>
(June 2025): A film, "Gaza: Medics Under Fire" was produced for the BBC,
but they <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/bbc-under-increasing-pressure-release-gaza-medics-documentary
>sat on it for months</a>, and are now <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/bbc-drops-film-about-gaza-doctors-after-delaying-its-broadcast-months
>not going to show it</a>.
Apparently it is being made available to the producers, Basement Films, to show.
