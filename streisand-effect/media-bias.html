  <H1>Media bias</H1>
Here we mention instances of serious bias by established news media.
This category doesn't naturally point you to recommended reading material,
but it may serve to warn against being misled by
<ul> <li>
selective presentation of material,
</li> <li>
choice of language to be sympathetic or unsympathetic to particular causes,
</li> <li>
or failure to fact-check sources which support the case to which they are
sympathetic.
</li> </ul>
