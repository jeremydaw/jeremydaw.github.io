Here we mention instances of serious bias by established news media.
This category doesn't naturally point you to recommended reading material,
but it may serve to warn against being misled by
<ul> <li>
selective presentation of material,
</li> <li>
choice of language to be sympathetic or unsympathetic to particular causes,
</li> <li>
or failure to fact-check sources which support the case to which they are
sympathetic.
</li> </ul>

<h2>BBC</h2>

I've seen more reported about the BBC than other media outlets.
I don't know if that is because they are worse than the others,
or just because we expect better of them.  Anyway, here goes:

(February 2025): Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone.
This documentary was shown on the BBC, and at first made available on
BBC iPlayer (a video on demand service), but then withdrawn:
<blockquote>
A campaign has sought to discredit the documentary using the
father of 14-year-old Abdullah Al-Yazouri, one of the film’s child
protagonists. Dr Ayman Al-Yazouri served as Gaza’s Deputy Minister of
Agriculture, a civil service role concerned with food production.
