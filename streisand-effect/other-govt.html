  <H1>Other Government actions</H1>
<p>
Here we list cases of government actions such as
travel restrictions (eg cancelling visas), arrest or mistreatment of
journalists, etc.
Also "sanctioning" individuals, preventing them from their normal activities,
without any proof of wrongdoing according to any legal definition, see this
article analysing this issue:

<h2>Jeremy Loffredo</h2>
Arrested apparently for a report about
<blockquote>
strikes launched at military targets inside Israel by Iran.
He was blindfolded, shackled in a military truck and placed in solitary
confinement for three days with little food or water. He was eventually
deported.
</blockquote>
Here is the
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu0zptW49eM >video report</a>,
here is a <a href =
https://thegrayzone.com/2024/10/11/israeli-jails-grayzones-jeremy-loffredo/
>Grayzone article about it</a>,
and here is <a href =
https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/israels-war-on-the-foreign-press
>an interview with Chris Hedges</a>.

<h2>Scott Ritter</h2>
<p>
I mention him after reading his account:
<blockquote>
Unfortunately, the US government had other plans - I was prevented from
boarding my flight out of JFK on June 3 by three armed Customs and Border
Protection officers, who seized my passport under instructions from the
State Department.
</blockquote>
as described <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/ask-the-inspectorus-tour-of-duty >here</a>,
but he also records that he had been "targeted" by the USA government
long before that:
<blockquote>
The FBI investigated me for making a documentary film, "In Shifting
Sands," which made the case that Iraq had been disarmed by UN weapons
inspectors. Because this movie embraced a narrative which contradicted
the case for war being made by the US government, I was targeted for
character assassination.
</blockquote>
That, and a lot else, are described <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/why-matt-gaetz-matters >here</a>.
</p> <p>
The film, full title
"In Shifting Sands: The Truth About Unscom and the Disarming of Iraq"
is on <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yjv4J6nxdk >Youtube here</a>.
Scott has a <a href = https://scottritter.substack.com/ >substack site</a>.
I came across <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/in-search-of-empathy>this article</a>
on it which I thought particularly worth reading.
</p> <p>
In a more recent <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test >article</a>
Scott says
<blockquote>
My house was raided by the FBI using FARA as a pretext; in conversations
with the senior FBI agents present, the justification for this raid
stemmed from an article I published on my Substack which addressed the
issue of Russophobia in America, and which incorporated material I had
received from the Russian Ambassador to the United States at the time,
Anatoly Antonov, whom I interviewed for this article.
</blockquote>
He doesn't identify the article but I'm guessing it is <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-red-scare-20-russophobia-in-america >
this one</a>.
</p> <p>
UPDATE (Feb 2025): Scott has written <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-russia-house
>a further article mentioning this event</a>,
mentioning <a href = https://ustourofduty.org/scott-ritter-show/
>The Scott Ritter Show</a>, which he felt he needed to terminate,
and describing a new subscription-based show
<a href = https://web.tribute.tg/s/mnz >The Russia House with Scott Ritter</a>.
</p> <p>
UPDATE (Feb 2025): Scott also describes <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-agent-zelensky
>his videos about Volodymyr Zelensky were taken down from Youtube</a>;
he has now published (presumably) similar material in a new video,
which is in the article.
</p> <p>
UPDATE (Apr 2025): In a <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/free-speech-and-the-apocalypse
>further article</a> Scott describes how the FBI raid impeded his latest book,
saying
<blockquote>
If the US government had its way, my latest book, <i>Highway to Hell:
The Armageddon Chronicles, 2015-2024</i>, would never have been written,
let alone published.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And the fact that the US government did its level best to keep this book
from being published should be even more reason for this book to be read
by every American.
</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Ali Abunimah</h2>
The <a href = https://electronicintifada.net/ >Electronic Intifada</a>'s
executive director <a href =
https://electronicintifada.net/people/ali-abunimah >Ali Abunimah</a> was
<a href = https://electronicintifada.net/content/eis-ali-abunimah-arrested-switzerland/50333 >
arrested by Swiss police</a>
ahead of a speaking event in Zurich on Saturday afternoon.
The article doesn't say what were the (alleged) grounds for this,
but no doubt Caitlin Johnstone sums it up well: <a href =
https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/another-journalist-arrested-in-another
>Another Journalist Arrested In Another Western Nation For Wrongthink About
Israel</a>.
<p>
I trust you can guess what are the consequent
Streisand Effect reading recommendations:
there are links above to the EI, and to Ali Abunimah's own articles there.
Also, he has written the books
“One Country: A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli-Palestinian Impasse” (2006)
and “The Battle for Justice In Palestine” (2014).

<h2>Sam Husseini and Max Blumenthal</h2>
<p>
Journalists Max Blumenthal and Sam Husseini attempted to ask
Secretary of State Antony Blinken questions during his final press conference,
but were ejected; in the case of Sam,
"I was carried off, seriously manhandled and handcuffed".
</p> <p>
Max is founder of <a href = https://thegrayzone.com/ >The Grayzone</a>,
which described the incident <a href =
https://thegrayzone.com/2025/01/18/journalists-dragged-out-blinken/ >here</a>;
Sam has a <a href = https://husseini.substack.com/ >substack</a>,
and described the incident, including a video, <a href =
https://husseini.substack.com/p/why-are-you-not-in-the-hague
>here</a>.
</p> <p>
<a href = https://decensored.news/ >Decensored News</a> also has a
<a href = https://decensored.news/max-blumenthal-antony-blinken-state-dept/
>video of the event</a>.
Apparently State Department spokesman Matthew Miller had
conspicuously refused, over a long time, to take questions from Sam, see
<a href = https://decensored.news/sam-husseini-antony-blinken-reporter-video/
>here</a> and
<a href =

>The State Department Inflicted a Concussion upon Me</a>.

<h2>Yves Engler</h2>
<p>
Canadian writer Yves Engler has been charged with
"harassment and indecent communication" on account of posts on
X (Twitter) criticising another writer Dahlia Kurtz
(apparently describing her as a “genocide” supporter and “fascist”).
He writes about her in more detail <a href =
https://yvesengler.com/2024/12/29/canadian-media-prioritizes-antisemitism-over-freezing-gaza-babies/
>here</a>.
Subsequently, Yves <a href =
https://yvesengler.com/2025/02/18/im-being-charged-for-responding-to-anti-palestinian-hate-on-x/
>wrote about the police actions</a>,
as a result of which the police investigator "feels threatened by [Yves's]
writing" which is <a href =
https://yvesengler.com/2025/02/19/police-angry-at-my-writing-about-ridiculous-charges-so-add-more/
>resulting in further charges</a>.
You can't make this stuff up.
</p> <p>
Yves also writes
<blockquote>
Over the past 24 hours I’ve received multiple messages about frivolous cases
brought against others for opposing genocide. The abuse of police and legal
system to target opponents of genocide is a greater problem than I realized.
</blockquote>
</p> <p>
The story is written up in JURISTnews, <a href =

<h3>USA sanctions on Francesca Albanese</h3>
Albanese, who is UN Special Rapporteur on Palestine,
had to address the UN General Assembly from the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy
Foundation in Cape Town, South Africa
because of sanctions imposed on her by the Trump administration.
This is described in <a href =

The article <!-- was also <a href =

and people's tribunals generally.
The Tribunal's website doesn't (yet) have a resulting report of conclusions,
but <a href = https://www.palcan-tribunal.ca/evidence >this page</a> seems to
link to submissions.

<h2> <a name = jacques-baud >Jacques Baud</a></h2>
As described in <a href = 
https://the307.substack.com/p/eu-sanctions-swiss-analyst-for-criticism
>EU Sanctions Swiss Analyst For Criticism Of The Ukraine Proxy War</a>,
archived <a href = https://archive.vn/66Y2E >here</a>,
the person discussed is
"Jacques Baud, a retired colonel in the Swiss army; former strategic analyst,
intelligence and terrorism specialist".
The article goes on to say
<blockquote>
Commenting on this, Alfred de Zayas, a former UN expert, noted, “We
are witnessing a civilizational collapse with the EU sanctioning Jacques
Baud, a retired Swiss colonel and intelligence officer, for publishing
books and articles expressing views on the Ukraine war contrary to those
of the NATO leadership.”
</blockquote>
The article describes Baud's views, and gives this example of his writing,
<a href = https://thepostil.com/the-military-situation-in-the-ukraine/ >

but clearly there are others, eg,

<h2> <a name = maccabi-tel-aviv >Maccabi Tel Aviv</a></h2>
<p>
Fans of this football club were banned from a match in Birmingham on account
of violent behaviour and their chants (see below) at previous matches,
detailed in these articles: <a href =
https://www.owenjones.news/p/maccabi-tel-aviv-thugs-were-being >

This website is focussed on enabling you to read material which others have
suppressed, censored, etc.
In this case I considered exercising discretion not to do so in this case.
However Sir Keir Starmer and Shabana Mahmood
strenuously opposed the ban and supported the club,
so in the light of my respect for these senior members of the UK government
I include the reported sayings of the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans.
