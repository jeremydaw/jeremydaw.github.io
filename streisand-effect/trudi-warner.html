  <H1>Trudi Warner : Jury Equity</H1>
<p>
Trudi Warner held up a placard outside a criminal court in London,
which said "JURORS YOU HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO ACQUIT A DEFENDANT
ACCORDING TO YOUR CONSCIENCE".
</p> <p>
This reflected a legal principle celebrated in a plaque at the Old Bailey
(Central Criminal Court in London), which says
<blockquote>
Near this site WILLIAM PENN and WILLIAM MEAD were tried in 1670 for
preaching to an unlawful assembly in Gracechurch Street. This tablet
commemorates the courage and endurance of the jury, Thomas Vere, Edward
Bushell and ten others, who refused to give a verdict against them
although locked up without food for two nights; and were fined for their
final verdict of Not Guilty. The case of these jurymen was reviewed on
a writ of habeas corpus and Chief Justice Vaughan delivered the opinion
of the Court which established the right of juries to give their verdict
according to their convictions.
</blockquote>
</p> <p>
The legal principles about a jury giving a "perverse acquittal"
have been reaffirmed by the House of Lords in 
<a href = https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/9.html >
R v Wang [2005] UKHL 9</a> thus
<blockquote>
12. ... [quoting DPP v Stonehouse [1978] AC 55] If the judge is satisfied
that, on the evidence, the jury would not be justified in acquitting
the accused and indeed that it would be perverse of them to do so, he
has no power to pre-empt the jury's verdict by directing them to convict.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
16. ... As it is, however, the acquittals of such high profile defendants
as Ponting, Randle and Pottle have been quite as much welcomed as resented
by the public, which over many centuries has adhered tenaciously to its
historic choice that decisions on the guilt of defendants charged with
serious crime should rest with a jury of lay people, randomly selected,
and not with professional judges.
[<a href = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/22/law.jurytrials >
This article describes the cases of Ponting, Randle and Pottle</a>].
That the last word should rest with the jury remains, as Sir Patrick
Devlin, writing in 1956, said (Hamlyn Lectures, pp 160, 162),
<blockquote>
"an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man's
idea of what is fair and just. If it does not, the jury will not be a
party to its enforcement …. The executive knows that in dealing with
the liberty of the subject it must not do anything which would seriously
disturb the conscience of the average member of Parliament or of the
average juryman. I know of no other real checks that exist today upon
the power of the executive."
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p> <p>
There was an application for permission to proceed against Ms Warner
for contempt, the point being that she (allegedly) was
"seeking to influence the jurors and in particular to acquit climate
change activists, whether or not such acquittal would be in accordance
with the trial judge's legal directions".
Permission was refused (ie, Ms Warner was successful), see
<a href = https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/2024/918.html >
HM Solicitor General v Warner [2024] EWHC 918 (KB)</a>.
David Allen Green has written an excellent article about this, <a href =
https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/law/65837/trudy-warner-placard-old-bailey-jury
>The placard of Trudi Warner</a>, 
<!-- <a href = https://archive.md/AEU1m > -->
in which he says 
<blockquote>
For the government, the rousing text of this judgment is even more unwelcome
than the offending text on the original placard. For with this illiberal
and misconceived application it has given the concept of jury equity more
circulation than would ever have been achieved by Warner’s placard.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Jury equity is something that existed, and which a prudent government took
notice of but did not shout about. But now, with this silly attempt to
criminalise Warner, the existence of jury equity will be better known
to those who do not read legal textbooks nor the walls of criminal
courts. It will even feature in legal blogs.
</blockquote>
(which is the whole point of this website - to publicise stuff which others
would prefer to remain hidden).
</p> <p>
Another excellent article, by "BarristerBlogger" Matthew Scott, is <a href =
https://barristerblogger.com/2024/04/21/i-dont-stand-with-trudi-warner/ >
I don’t stand with Trudi Warner</a>, which was written before the judgment
in the Trudi Warner case.  I rather think the result of that case will
have surprised him.
</p>

<h2>The judgment in the Warner case</h2>
The judgment linked above in favour of Ms Warner discusses "jury equity"
(which it explains as the power of the jury to give a verdict according
to conscience) in paras 13 to 21; it includes the following points
<ul> <li>
para 11: The judge hearing the case in the court where Ms Warner held her
placard told the jury "You try the case on the evidence you hear in this room
and no more.  ... If you are sure of guilt on the evidence you
<i>have to convict</i>.
He further referred to "any further <i>false impressions</i> which people
seem to think it is sensible to try and impart to jurors" [my emphases].
</li> <li>
16. The principle of jury equity is well-established in our common law. 
</li> <li>
18. ... a jury is entitled to acquit and its reasons for so doing are unknown.
It is their right which cannot be questioned.
</li> <li>
19.  Counsel agreed that participants in the trial process cannot lawfully
invite a jury to apply the principle of jury equity or indeed to inform
them of it. [this is weird - discussed more below - and of course it's all
the more reason why jurors should be made aware of it outside the trial!]
</li> <li>
37 (1) [the placard] simply communicated directly with jurors to summarise
the principle of jury equity in a way which is not far from Lord Bingham's
description in Wang and indeed very similar to the Old Bailey plaque. It
did not suggest to jurors they should exercise their right to acquit
according to their conscience, just that it was a power that they have
</li> <li>
39. ... Ms Warner accurately informed potential prospective jurors
about one of their legal powers. ... It is not unlawful to accurately
communicate the bare principle of law to potential jurors in a public forum.
</li> <li>
40. ... the judge is under a duty to only tell the jury to follow
his/her directions, but juries retain a power to acquit contrary to
those directions if the jurors' convictions require it.
</li> <li>
42. ... what her Placard said outside the Court reflects essentially what is
regularly read on the Old Bailey plaque by jurors, and what our highest
courts recognise as part of our constitutional landscape.
</li> </ul>
Thus the quote above from paragraph 40 gives an excellent set of words for 
another such placard: "juries retain a power to acquit contrary to
the judge's directions if their convictions require it", presumably 
something that Judge Reid would prefer they remained unaware!

<h2>Jury Equity</h2>
In fact it is somewhat controversial, since it may be used to acquit
defendants who don't deserve sympathy.  
This may explain the bizarre combination (see above) of 
<ul> <li>
participants in the trial process cannot lawfully invite a jury
to apply the principle of jury equity <i>or indeed to inform them of it</i>
</li> <li>
juries retain a power to acquit contrary to [the judge's]
directions if the jurors' convictions require it.
</li> </ul>
Canadian cases have affirmed the principle of jury equity but also said
that defending counsel shouldn't invite a jury to apply it.
In <a href =
https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/288/index.do >
R v Krieger [2006] 2 SCR 501</a> it was said
<blockquote>
<p>
27. It has since then been well established that under the system of
justice we have inherited from England juries are not entitled as a
matter of right to refuse to apply the law — but they do have the
power to do so when their consciences permit of no other course.
</p> <p>
28  The matter was put this way long ago by Lord Mansfield in
R. v. Shipley (1784), 4 Dougl. 73, 99 E.R. 774, at p. 824 (cited by
Dickson C.J. in R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 78):
<blockquote>
It is the duty of the Judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell
the jury how to do right, though they have it in their power to do wrong,
which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.
</blockquote>
</p>
</blockquote>
(Both this case and R v Wang went to appeal because the jury had been
<i>directed</i> to return a verdict of Guilty.)
The case mentioned there, <a href =
https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/288/index.do >
R. v. Morgentaler [1988] 1 SCR 30</a>, well illustrates the conflict in 
lawyers' minds about the issue of jury equity. (So this is an awfully long
quote - sorry!).  Starting near the bottom of page 76, we see
<blockquote>
<p>
Defence Counsel's Address to the Jury
</p> <p>
In his concluding remarks to the jury at the trial of the appellants,
defence counsel asserted:
<blockquote>
The judge will tell you what the law is. He will tell you about the
ingredients of the offence, what the Crown has to prove, what the defences
may be or may not be, and you must take the law from him. But I submit to
you that it is up to you and you alone to apply the law to this evidence
and you have a right to say it shouldn't be applied.
</blockquote>
The burden of his argument was that the jury should not apply s. 251
if they thought that it was a bad law, and that, in refusing to apply
the law, they could send a signal to Parliament that the law should be
changed. Although my disposition of the appeal makes it unnecessary,
strictly speaking, to review Mr. Manning's argument before the jury,
I find the argument so troubling that I feel compelled to comment.
</p> <p>
It has long been settled in Anglo-Canadian criminal law that in a trial
before judge and jury, the judge's role is to state the law and the
jury's role is to apply that law to the facts of the case. In Joshua
v. The Queen, [1955] A.C. 121 (P.C.), at p. 130, Lord Oaksey enunciated
the principle succinctly:
<blockquote>
It is a general principle of British law that on a trial by jury it is
for the judge to direct the jury on the law and in so far as he thinks
necessary on the facts, but the jury, whilst they must take the law from
the judge, are the sole judges on the facts.
</blockquote> <blockquote>
The jury is one of the great protectors of the citizen because it is
composed of twelve persons who collectively express the common sense of
the community. But the jury members are not expert in the law, and for
that reason they must be guided by the judge on questions of law.
</blockquote>
The contrary principle contended for by Mr. Manning, that a jury may
be encouraged to ignore a law it does not like, could lead to gross
inequities. One accused could be convicted by a jury who supported
the existing law, while another person indicted for the same offence
could be acquitted by a jury who, with reformist zeal, wished to express
disapproval of the same law. Moreover, a jury could decide that although
the law pointed to a conviction, the jury would simply refuse to apply
the law to an accused for whom it had sympathy. Alternatively, a jury
who feels antipathy towards an accused might convict despite a law which
points to acquittal. To give a harsh but I think telling example, a jury
fueled by the passions of racism could be told that they need not apply
the law against murder to a white man who had killed a black man. Such
a possibility need only be stated to reveal the potentially frightening
implications of Mr. Manning's assertions. The dangerous argument that
a jury may be encouraged to disregard the law was castigated as long
ago as 1784 by Lord Mansfield in a criminal libel case, R. v. Shipley
(1784), 4 Dougl. 73, 99 E.R. 774, at p. 824:
<blockquote>
So the jury who usurp the judicature of law, though they happen to be
right, are themselves wrong, because they are right by chance only,
and have not taken the constitutional way of deciding the question. It
is the duty of the Judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the
jury how to do right, though they have it in their power to do wrong,
which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.
</blockquote> <blockquote>
To be free is to live under a government by law .... Miserable is
the condition of individuals, dangerous is the condition of the State,
if there is no certain law, or, which is the same thing, no certain
administration of law, to protect individuals, or to guard the State.
</blockquote> <blockquote>
...
</blockquote> <blockquote>
In opposition to this, what is contended for? -- That the law shall be,
in every particular cause, what any twelve men, who shall happen to be
the jury, shall be inclined to think; liable to no review, and subject
to no control, under all the prejudices of the popular cry of the day,
and under all the bias of interest in this town, where thousands, more
or less, are concerned in the publication of newspapers, paragraphs,
and pamphlets. Under such an administration of law, no man could tell,
no counsel could advise, whether a paper was or was not punishable.
</blockquote>
I can only add my support to that eloquent statement of principle.
</p> <p>
It is no doubt true that juries have a de facto power to disregard the law
as stated to the jury by the judge. We cannot enter the jury room. The
jury is never called upon to explain the reasons which lie behind a
verdict. It may even be true that in some limited circumstances the
private decision of a jury to refuse to apply the law will constitute,
in the words of a Law Reform Commission of Canada working paper,
"the citizen's ultimate protection against oppressive laws and the
oppressive enforcement of the law" (Law Reform Commission of Canada,
Working Paper 27, The Jury in Criminal Trials (1980)). But recognizing
this reality is a far cry from suggesting that counsel may encourage a
jury to ignore a law they do not support <i>or to tell a jury that it has
a right to do so</i>. The difference between accepting the reality of de
facto discretion in applying the law and elevating such discretion to
the level of a right was stated clearly by the United States Court of
Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, in United States v. Dougherty,
473 F.2d 1113 (1972), per Leventhal J., at p. 1134: [my <i>emphasis</i>]
</p> <p>
The jury system has worked out reasonably well overall, providing "play
in the joints" that imparts flexibility and avoid[s] undue rigidity. An
equilibrium has evolved -- an often marvelous balance -- with the jury
acting as a "safety valve" for exceptional cases, without being a wildcat
or runaway institution. There is reason to believe that the simultaneous
achievement of modest jury equity and avoidance of intolerable caprice
depends on formal instructions that do not expressly delineate a jury
charter to carve out its own rules of law.
</p> <p>
To accept Mr. Manning's argument that defence counsel should be able to
encourage juries to ignore the law would be to disturb the "marvelous
balance" of our system of criminal trials before a judge and jury. Such
a disturbance would be irresponsible. I agree with the trial judge and
with the Court of Appeal that Mr. Manning was quite simply wrong to
say to the jury that if they did not like the law they need not enforce
it. He should not have done so.
</p>
</blockquote>
In his book <i>The Justice Game</i> human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson
records, about the trial of Randle and Pottle,  
<blockquote>
I had to ... withdraw from the case - I could not ethically invite the jury
to ignore a law I was sworn to uphold. Pat and Michael defended themsleves
and invited the jury to acquit (which it did), as a protest ...
</blockquote>
By contrast, the position in Australia is different: in <a href =
https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1977/10.html >
Yager v R [1977] HCA 10</a> a bare majority of the judges considered
that a judge could, in a case where the critical facts were uncontested,
direct a conviction.
[I must say that this particular case strikes me as an excellent example
of why a jury should be prepared to consider acquittal in the face of
uncontested facts and a clear direction as to the law by the judge,
but that's another story].
There is interesting discussion of this in the judgment of Murphy J 
(the last judgment) in <a href =
https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/1976/16.html >
Jackson v R [1976] HCA 16</a>.
And in a more recent Australian case, <a href = 
http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2010/17.html >
R v LK [2010] HCA 17</a>, French CJ seemed to doubt the dicta in Yager v R,
saying
<blockquote>
A "perverse" verdict of not guilty on the other hand has traditionally
been seen as a protection against oppressive laws or prosecutions.
</blockquote>
 
Historian E P Thompson, in “The State versus its ‘Enemies’,” quoted <a href = 
https://inthemiddleofthewhirlwind.wordpress.com/%E2%80%9Cthe-people%E2%80%99s-business%E2%80%9D-puerilities-and-pallas/
>here</a>, wrote about the jury,
<blockquote>
Time and again, when judges and law officers, mounted on high horses,
have been riding at breakneck speed towards some convenient despotism,
those shadowy figures – not particularly good nor especially true –
have risen from the bushes beside the highway and flung a gate across
their path. They are known to historians as the Gang of Twelve.
</blockquote>
The Barrister Magazine also discusses these issues in <a href =

>We are All Trudi Warner! Promoting the Rights of Jurors in the Twenty First
Century</a>


<h2>Defences - the Colston statue ; Extinction Rebellion</h2>
<p>
So the above discussion is about juries simply acquitting contrary
to the facts as they decide them and the law as they are directed.
But one never knows the reasons for a jury's decision, and so in any of
these cases they may have simply come to a decision on the facts
different from what others might consider the only reasonable decision.
There are some recent widely publicised cases where this may have been so.
</p> <p>
The Colston statue case: a statue of Edward Colston was thrown into the
harbour, on account of Colston's involvement in slave-trading.
The judge instructed the jury on several possible varieties of "lawful excuse"
which the defendants might have had. They were acquitted.
There was an appeal about the correctness of some of the judge's directions,
see <a href = https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2022/1259.html >
[2022] EWCA Crim 1259</a>.
</p> <p>
The judgment doesn't discuss the situation of an acquittal given contrary to
the facts and law, out of sympathy to the accused, it's about the defences
raised. It does say (in para 118) that
<blockquote>
[if] an issue does not arise on the evidence [then] no direction
need be given about it to the jury
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
a judge may withdraw an issue from the jury if no reasonable jury
properly directed could reach a particular conclusion
</blockquote>
(On this last point, see also <a href =
https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2013/435.html >
Asmeron v R. [2013] EWCA Crim 435</a>, paras 20-22,
which doesn't quite say the same thing).
But otherwise, Wang (linked above), paras 8 and 12, make it clear that
<blockquote>
the judge tells the jury the law so that they can apply it to the facts
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is the function of the jury ... not only to find the facts
and to draw inferences from the facts, but ... also to apply the law,
as they are directed upon it, to the facts as they find them to be.
</blockquote>
This means essentially that in a case such as that of the Colston statue,
one never knows whether the jury have acquitted on the basis of the defences
raised before them, or have simply given a "perverse acquittal".
Thus some of the articles about this, such as <a href =
https://barristerblogger.com/2020/06/08/the-colston-statue-destroyers-have-no-defence-in-law-but-they-will-never-be-convicted/
>The Colston statue destroyers have no defence in law but they will never be
convicted</a>, and <a href =

>The Colston Four and ‘perverse’ jury verdicts: a very English tradition</a>
discuss both situations.
</p>
<h2>Withdrawing an issue or defence from the jury</h2>
A similar appeal against the judges rulings concerned a case where defendants
were acquitted of damaging property - mostly with paint, but also a smashed
window. It is <a href =
https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2024/243.html >
[2024] EWCA Crim 243</a>. 
Paragraphs 54 to 64 discuss Asmeron (which I mention above), concluding
<blockquote>
A judge may withdraw a defence from a jury if no reasonable jury properly
directed could reach a particular conclusion. We emphasise that a judge
must exercise considerable caution before taking that step. It is not
for the judge to substitute his or her decision for that of the jury when
deciding to withdraw the defence. The judge is only entitled to withdraw
the defence from the jury where <i>no reasonable jury</i>, properly directed,
could find the defence to be made out. [<i>emphasis</i> as in the judgment]
</blockquote>
Now you may wonder why I've gone on at such length about this.
The point is that if the judge withdraws a defence from the jury,
it's quite sensible for him to stop the defendant talking about it
(after all, it would be a waste of time).  But what the defendant
wants to talk about may be exactly what might lead the jury to consider
a "perverse acquittal".

<h2>Judge Silas Reid and Trudi Warner ; Defend Our Juries</h2>
So here is where Trudi Warner and her placard comes in.
Judge Silas Reid has considerable form in instructing defendants not to
mention the motivations for their actions - presumably because they are
not relevant to any defence to the alleged crime - and gaoling those who 
disobey for contempt of court.
And of course this would also prevent them seeking a "perverse acquittal".
One such was Trudi Warner's lodger.
So on a subsequent occasion she held up the placard outside Judge Reid's court.
He had her arrested.
