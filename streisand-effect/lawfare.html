  <H1>Lawfare</H1>
<p>
Here we feature people who have been sued for what they have said
or written, with the motive of silencing them or to deter others.
</p> <p>
For example, <a href =
https://mondoweiss.net/2019/03/lawyers-relationship-government/ >
this article about UK Lawyers for Israel</a> says
<blockquote>
The ‘lawfare’ organisation has especially targeted organisations
promoting the Palestinian-initiated Boycott Divestment and Sanctions
(BDS)  movement – from academics to students unions, architects to
local councils – by lodging complaints with regulatory bodies and
sending letters threatening legal action.

article, by Jonathan Cook</a>, archived <a href = https://archive.vn/f7PMd >

</p> <p>
The <a href = https://www.pilc.org.uk >Public Interest Law Centre</a> and the
<a href = https://elsc.support/ >European Legal Support Center</a> have
made a complaint against the Director of UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI)
for <a href =

about letters "which demonstrate a seeming pattern of vexatious and legally
baseless correspondence aimed at silencing and intimidating Palestine
solidarity efforts".

It concerns Jones's article <a href =

Campaign Against Antisemitism loses "vexatious" court case against
Reginald D. Hunter</a>, archived <a href = https://archive.vn/iIJpy > here</a>.
The article discusses the issue of "lawfare", and how in this case the
private prosecution was found to be vexatious, the <a href =
https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The-Campaign-Against-Antisemitism-v-Reginald-Hunter.pdf
>judgment is here</a>.
</p> <p>
The article mentions other cases, one of which is discussed next.
</p>

<h2>Shaun Lawson - Jane Heybroek</h2>
<p>
Shaun Lawson published a long article called <a href =
https://shaunjlawson.medium.com/enough-is-enough-rachel-riley-gnasherjew-and-the-political-weaponisation-of-antisemitism-da21ccc7da67
> "Enough is Enough: Rachel Riley, GnasherJew, and the Political Weaponisation
of Antisemitism"</a>,
archived <a href = https://archive.vn/WSOD1 >here</a> (also
<a href = https://archive.vn/TM6i2 >here</a>).
It discusses many aspects of British politics, with a particular focus on 
accusations of anti-semitism (a topic which I discuss at length <a href =
./antisemitism.html >here</a>), and individuals involved.
</p> <p>
This resulted in a rebuttal and response by Lawson, and a threat to sue him
by an actress Tracy Ann Oberman.
So Lawson wrote a second long article, called <a href =
https://shaunjlawson.medium.com/beneath-contempt-how-tracy-ann-oberman-and-rachel-riley-harassed-dogpiled-and-slandered-a-22663fe709e
>"Beneath Contempt: How Tracy Ann Oberman and Rachel Riley harassed, dogpiled
and slandered a 16-year-old child and her father"</a>,
archived <a href = https://archive.vn/e8aeb >here</a> (also
<a href = https://archive.vn/QXQlj >here</a>).
This second article discusses antisemitism in Britain,
criticising media coverage of it, and the ignorance of the British public on 
several matters, which he blames on the media.
But most of the article is about Tracy Ann Oberman's conduct repeatedly
tweeting a girl (described as harassment).
</p> <p>
It appears that a barrister Jane Heybroek was sued by Olberman and another 
media figure Rachel Riley for "retweeting a link to" the second Lawson article,
the case being described at <a href =
https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2020/1259.html >[2020] EWHC 1259
(QB)</a>.
It was later dropped, see <a href =
https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/latest-news/tv-personalities-withdraw-libel-claim-against-barrister
>Rachel Riley and Tracy Ann Oberman drop libel case against barrister</a>.
There was no indication of why this particular person was sued, among
the “hundreds of people” who retweeted or shared the article,
or rather than the author of the article.

<blockquote>
Ms Heybroek said that – notwithstanding being a barrister – it had
been “a long, and at times exhausting experience, and I would not wish
anyone to find themselves on the receiving end of legal action”.
<br><br>
She noted too that the claimants were represented under a conditional
fee agreement backed by after-the-event insurance, meaning “there was
almost no risk to them in bringing the claim”.
<br><br>
She spent £30,000 herself defending the claims and then raised £45,000
through crowdfunding website CrowdJustice.
</blockquote>
Which goes to show that it is far too easy, for those who are in a position
to take action like this, to clamp down on unfavourable commentary.
