  <H1>Universities, etc</H1>
<p>
Here we list cases where universities (etc)
punish or censor staff or students
account of the political views expressed.
There are many of them, especially cases in Australia, mentioned in <a href = 
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/01/22/xayw-j22.html>this article</a>.
</p> <p>
Frequently such people are accused of antisemitism, so it is useful to point
to <a href =

She is a "well-known pro-Palestinian academic at Sydneyâ€™s Macquarie
University", much criticised for things she has said, which I haven't
found quoted in full. Some have urged that she be sacked from her academic
position. 
The <a href = 
>World Socialist Web Site article mentioned above</a> is largely about this 
cases as are the following ones,
