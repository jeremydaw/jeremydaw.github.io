<p>
Here we list cases where universities (etc)
punish or censor staff or students
account of the political views expressed.
There are many of them, especially cases in Australia, mentioned in <a href =
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/01/22/xayw-j22.html >this article</a>,
and in the USA, described in this interview <a href =
https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/inside-americas-academic-gulags-w >
Inside America's Academic Gulags</a>
</p> <p>
Frequently such people are accused of antisemitism, so it is useful to point
to <a href =

</p> <p>
And here is an academic article on the subject, <a href =

<h2>Randa Abdel-Fattah</h2>
<p>
She is a "well-known pro-Palestinian academic at Sydney’s Macquarie
University", much criticised for things she has said, which I haven't
found quoted in full. Some have urged that she be sacked from her academic
position.
The <a href =
>World Socialist Web Site article mentioned above</a> is largely about this
cases as are the following ones,

<h2> <a name = david-miller >David Miller</a></h2>
<p>
David Miller was an academic at the University of Bristol,
who was dismissed by the University, despite a history <a href =
https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/david-miller-was-cleared-anti-semitism-leaked-document-shows
>described here</a>.
An Employment Tribunal found he had been unfairly dismissed, see the <a href =
https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Miller-judgment-1400780.2022-JDT.pdf
>judgment</a>.
The case was <a href =
https://redmans.co.uk/insights/david-millers-anti-zionist-beliefs-are-protected-characteristics-tribunal-says-in-miller-v-bristol-dismissal-case/
>discussed by solicitors here</a>.
</p> <p>
It seems he would express himself strongly, eg
<blockquote>
Zionism is and always has been a racist, violent, imperialist
ideology premised on ethnic cleansing (para 97(iii))
</blockquote>
(this in an email to a student who had referred to him as an
“utterly vile antisemite” (para 93)).
</p> <p>
But the judgment several times makes clear that the University did not
accuse him of antisemitism:
<ul> <li>
(par 233) the respondent [the University] confirmed at the last preliminary
hearing that its position was that nothing the claimant
said or did was antisemitic
</li> <li>
(par 305) even on the respondent’s analysis what the claimant said
was accepted as lawful, was not antisemitic
</li> <li>
(par 491) the University was also careful to say
that it was not alleging that the tweets were antisemitic
</li> </ul>
One of the matters complained about was the article <a href =
https://electronicintifada.net/content/we-must-resist-israels-war-british-universities/32391
>We must resist Israel’s war on British universities</a>.
</p> <p>
However he was criticised for what he said and wrote about students
and University student societies (eg paras 284 to 291, 471)
</p> <p>
Here is a <a href = https://supportmiller.org/ >website supporting him</a>,
and here is the transcript of a long talk by him, <a href =

<h2>Katherine Franke</h2>
<p>
A long-time law professor at Columbia University in New York,
"[she came] to the view that the Columbia University administration
has created such a toxic and hostile environment for legitimate debate
around the war in Israel and Palestine that [she could]
no longer teach or conduct research."
This followed proceedings against her for a statement made in an <a href =
https://www.democracynow.org/2024/1/25/columbia_palestine_protest_attack
>interview on Democracy Now! on January 25, 2024</a>.
See <a href = https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2025/01/Statement%20from%20Katherine%20Franke.docx.pdf
>her statement on the case</a> and <a href =

>several more interviews on Democracy Now!</a>
She was also <a href =
https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/americas-constitutional-crisis-w
>interviewed by Chris Hedges</a>.
</p> <p>
An interesting tidbit in <a href =
https://www.democracynow.org/2024/9/5/katherine_franke >this interview</a> is
<blockquote>
... attorney Kathleen Peratis, who is representing Franke along with
the Center for Constitutional Rights after she quit her former law firm,
Outten & Golden, because it dropped Franke as a client, saying she was
too controversial. “What happened at Outten & Golden is the kind of
thing that’s happening all over,” says Peratis.

<h2>Shahd Abusalama</h2>
<p>
Shahd Abusalama was <a href =
https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-news/2022/01/30/shahd-abusalamas-suspension-appears-to-be-a-malicious-attack-on-free-speech/
>suspended from her position at Sheffield Hallam University</a>,
apparently on account of allegations of antisemitism, although, apparently,
these were not communicated specifically to her.
It seems that quite soon <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-palestinian-academic-fully-reinstated-antisemitism-claims-dropped
>the suspension was lifted and the investigation of her was dropped</a>.
</p> <p>
The second article linked above says
<blockquote>
the university alleged that Abusalama had broken the university’s
rules, specifically the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance (IHRA) working definition (sic) of antisemitism
</blockquote>
Presumably the University had not actually read the "definition",
see my comments on it <a href = ./antisemitism.html#ihra >here</a>.
</p> <p>
A blog called Engage alleges <a href =
https://engageonline.wordpress.com/2022/02/03/sheffield-hallam-ucu-passed-a-second-antisemitic-motion/
>SHU UCU passed a second antisemitic motion,
this time in support of Shahd Absulama</a>.
Conveniently, the text of the motion is included in the article,
as are some tweets by Abusalama, prsumably those to which objection was taken.
You can judge whether they are antisemitic.

<h2>Teddy Katz - Tantura</h2>
<p>
As recounted in <a href =
https://karat.substack.com/p/tantura-anniversary-of-a-buried-war
>Tantura, Anniversary of a buried War Crime</a>
<blockquote>
When an Israeli graduate student named Theodore “Teddy” Katz finally
exposed the truth [about the Tantura massacre] in 2000 through painstaking
oral history research, he faced a vicious backlash: lawsuits, public
vilification, and the suppression of his work. The Tantura affair became
emblematic of how Israeli academia and society silenced inconvenient
histories of the Nakba.
</blockquote>
But the recordings he made of conversations with witnesses (both victims
and perpetrators) survived, and became the basis of a
documentary film “Tantura” in 2022 by Israeli filmmaker Alon Schwarz.
The documentary is described at length by Haaretz: <a href =
https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-01-20/ty-article-magazine/theres-a-mass-palestinian-grave-at-a-popular-israeli-beach-veterans-confess/0000017f-f230-d223-a97f-fffdbd5b0000
>There's a Mass Palestinian Grave at a Popular Israeli Beach,
Veterans Confess</a>
And here is a very personal account by the daughter of a man involved in the
campaign against Katz: <a href =
https://www.zochrot.org/testimonies/view/56414/en
>On the Massacre in Tantura</a>
</p> <p>
At Haifa, <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilan_Papp%C3%A9
>Dr. Ilan Pappé</a> supported Katz, but
<blockquote>
found himself increasingly isolated and vilified by peers. Within a few
years, Pappé too would be driven out: in 2007, amid death threats and
official censure for his vocal criticism of Israel’s Nakba denial,
he resigned and left Israel to teach in the UK.
</blockquote>
Here is an article written by Pappé about it: <a href =
https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/15238
>The Tantura case in Israel: The Katz research and trial</a>.

<h2><a name = michael-eisen >Michael Eisen</a></h2>
<p>
Michael Eisen, editor-in-chief of life sciences academic journal eLife,
<a href = https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-reporters-fired-pro-palestinian-remarks-1837834
>has been removed from his post.</a>
The following are quoted from the Newsweek article.
</p> <p>
On October 13, satirical news site The Onion published a piece with the
headline: <a href =
https://theonion.com/dying-gazans-criticized-for-not-using-last-words-to-con-1850925657/
>"Dying Gazans Criticized For Not Using Last Words To Condemn Hamas."</a>
</p> <p>
Eisen, who is Jewish and has Israeli family members, responded to the
piece posting on X, formerly Twitter: "The Onion speaks with more courage,
insight and moral clarity than the leaders of every academic institution
put together. I wish there were a TheOnion university.
</p> <p>
"Every sane person on Earth is horrified and traumatized by what Hamas did
and wants it to never happen again," he added. "But I am also horrified
by the collective punishment already being meted out on Gazans, and the
worse that is about to come."
</p> <p>
Then, on Tuesday, eLife's board of directors released a statement
in which it said it had decided to replace Eisen as editor.
</p> <p>
While eLife's board of directors did not specifically mention the tweet,
Eisen wrote the previous day that he had been informed he was being
replaced for, as he put it, "retweeting a TheOnion piece that calls out
indifference to the lives of Palestinian civilians."
