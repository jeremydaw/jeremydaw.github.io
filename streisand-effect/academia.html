  <H1>Universities, etc</H1>
<p>
Here we list cases where universities (etc)
punish or censor staff or students
account of the political views expressed.
There are many of them, especially cases in Australia, mentioned in <a href = 
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/01/22/xayw-j22.html>this article</a>.
</p> <p>
Frequently such people are accused of antisemitism, so it is useful to point
to <a href = 
https://jca-28cddc.webflow.io/media/open-letter-to-jason-clare-mp-targeting-of-antiracist-academics-evidence-of-rising-repression-of-dissent
>this letter from the Jewish Council of Australia</a>.
</p> <p>
And here is an academic article on the subject, <a href = 
https://research-management.mq.edu.au/ws/portalfiles/portal/390105693/Publisher_version.pdf
>Palestine Solidarity and Zionist Backlash in Australian Universities, by 
Jumana Bayeha and Nick Riemer</a>
</p>

<h2>Randa Abdel-Fattah</h2>
<p>
She is a "well-known pro-Palestinian academic at Sydney’s Macquarie
University", much criticised for things she has said, which I haven't
found quoted in full. Some have urged that she be sacked from her academic
position. 
The <a href = 
>World Socialist Web Site article mentioned above</a> is largely about this 
cases as are the following ones,

<h2> <a name = david-miller ></a> David Miller </a> </h2>
<p>
David Miller was an academic at the University of Bristol, 
who was dismissed by the University, despite a history <a href =
https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/david-miller-was-cleared-anti-semitism-leaked-document-shows
>described here</a>. 
An Employment Tribunal found he had been unfairly dismissed, see the <a href =
https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Miller-judgment-1400780.2022-JDT.pdf
>judgment</a>.
The case was <a href =
https://redmans.co.uk/insights/david-millers-anti-zionist-beliefs-are-protected-characteristics-tribunal-says-in-miller-v-bristol-dismissal-case/
>discussed by solicitors here</a>.
</p> <p>
It seems he would express himself strongly, eg
<blockquote>
Zionism is and always has been a racist, violent, imperialist
ideology premised on ethnic cleansing (para 97(iii))
</blockquote>
(this in an email to a student who had referred to him as an
“utterly vile antisemite” (para 93)).
</p> <p>
But the judgment several times makes clear that the University did not
accuse him of antisemitism:
<ul> <li>
(par 233) the respondent [the University] confirmed at the last preliminary
hearing that its position was that nothing the claimant
said or did was antisemitic
</li> <li>
(par 305) even on the respondent’s analysis what the claimant said
was accepted as lawful, was not antisemitic
</li> <li>
(par 491) the University was also careful to say
that it was not alleging that the tweets were antisemitic
</li> </ul>
One of the matters complained about was the article <a href = 
https://electronicintifada.net/content/we-must-resist-israels-war-british-universities/32391
>We must resist Israel’s war on British universities</a>.
</p> <p>
However he was criticised for what he said and wrote about students
and University student societies (eg paras 284 to 291, 471)
</p> <p>
David has written a lot of <a href = 
https://english.almayadeen.net/authors/david-miller
>articles on Al Mayadeen</a>, and on
  <a href = https://trackingpower.substack.com/ >his own substack</a>.
</p> <p>
He is the founder of the UK’s lobbying watchdog <a href =
https://spinwatch.org/ >Spinwatch</a>.
</p> <p>
David was one of several academic authors of a book, <a href = 
https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745340661/bad-news-for-labour/
>Bad News for Labour: Antisemitism, the Party and Public Belief</a>.
But a book launch event was <a href = 
https://www.plutobooks.com/blog/bad-news-for-labour-boycotts-book-launches-and-abuse/
>cancelled by Waterstones</a>.

<h2>Katherine Franke</h2>
<p>
A long-time law professor at Columbia University in New York,
"[she came] to the view that the Columbia University administration
has created such a toxic and hostile environment for legitimate debate
around the war in Israel and Palestine that [she could]
no longer teach or conduct research."
This followed proceedings against her for a statement made in an <a href =
https://www.democracynow.org/2024/1/25/columbia_palestine_protest_attack
>interview on Democracy Now! on January 25, 2024</a>.
See <a href = https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2025/01/Statement%20from%20Katherine%20Franke.docx.pdf
>her statement on the case</a> and <a href =
https://www.democracynow.org/appearances/katherine_franke
>several more interviews on Democracy Now!</a>
She was also <a href =
https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/americas-constitutional-crisis-w
>interviewed by Chris Hedges</a>.
</p> <p>
An interesting tidbit in <a href =
https://www.democracynow.org/2024/9/5/katherine_franke >this interview</a> is
<blockquote>
... attorney Kathleen Peratis, who is representing Franke along with
the Center for Constitutional Rights after she quit her former law firm,
Outten & Golden, because it dropped Franke as a client, saying she was
too controversial. “What happened at Outten & Golden is the kind of
thing that’s happening all over,” says Peratis.

<h2>Shahd Abusalama</h2>
<p>
Shahd Abusalama was <a href =
https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-news/2022/01/30/shahd-abusalamas-suspension-appears-to-be-a-malicious-attack-on-free-speech/
>suspended from her position at Sheffield Hallam University</a>,
apparently on account of allegations of antisemitism, although, apparently,
these were not communicated specifically to her.
It seems that quite soon <a href =
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-palestinian-academic-fully-reinstated-antisemitism-claims-dropped
>the suspension was lifted and the investigation of her was dropped</a>.
</p> <p>
The second article linked above says
<blockquote>
the university alleged that Abusalama had broken the university’s
rules, specifically the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance (IHRA) working definition (sic) of antisemitism
</blockquote>
Presumably the University had not actually read the "definition",
see my comments on it <a href = ./antisemitism.html#ihra >here</a>.
</p> <p>
A blog called Engage alleges <a href =
https://engageonline.wordpress.com/2022/02/03/sheffield-hallam-ucu-passed-a-second-antisemitic-motion/
>SHU UCU passed a second antisemitic motion,
this time in support of Shahd Absulama</a>.
Conveniently, the text of the motion is included in the article,
as are some tweets by Abusalama, prsumably those to which objection was taken.
You can judge whether they are antisemitic.
</p> <p>
There has subsequently been further <a href =

</p> <p>
She was <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBmx5jPPFDE
>interviewed by 5pillars</a>, shown on Youtube.
Dr Abusalama writes a blog called <a href = https://palestinefrommyeyes.com/ >
