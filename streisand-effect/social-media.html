  <H1>Social media censorship</H1>
Here we list cases where social media platforms
"de-platform" particular contributors on
account of the political views expressed, and delete their articles,
or restrict visibility of some articles/videos.
Also where payment processors refuse to process payments for particular content
creators, for similar reasons.

<h2>Scott Ritter</h2>
In <a href = https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test
>this article</a> referring to his two-part documentary, "Agent Zelensky"
he says
<blockquote>
YouTube deplatformed the documentary, demonetized my account, and
eventually banned me from the platform altogether.
</blockquote>
This documentary is described
<a href =

>here,</a>
<a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/agent-zelensky-part-1
>here,</a>
and <a href =

and is available on Rumble

>here</a>.

<h2>Chris Hedges</h2>
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/on-being-disappeared >
He writes</a>
<blockquote> <p>
The entire archive of On Contact, the Emmy-nominated show I hosted for six
years for RT America and RT International, has been disappeared from YouTube...
</p> <p>
I was on RT because, as a critic of US imperialism, militarism, the
corporate control of the two ruling parties, and especially because I
support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel,
I was blacklisted.  I was on RT for the same reason the dissident Vaclav
Havel, who I knew, was on Voice of America during the communist regime
in Czechoslovakia. It was that or not be heard. Havel had no more love
for the policies of Washington than I have for those of Moscow.
</p> <p>
What were my sins? I did not, like my former employer, The New York
Times, sell you the lie of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, peddle
conspiracy theories about Donald Trump being a Russian asset, put out a
ten-part podcast called the Caliphate that was a hoax, or tell you that
the contents on Hunter Biden’s laptop was “disinformation.”
</p> </blockquote>
<p>
In fact an <a href = https://www.rt.com/shows/on-contact/ >
archive of the On Contact shows</a> seems to be available on rt.com,
but only up to February 2022 (shortly before the article linked above
appeared). Then there is also a <a href =
https://www.youtube.com/@chrishedges7414/videos >Youtube channel</a>
currently available which apparently contains episodes from 7 and 8 years ago.
</p> <p>
Meanwhile, he has lots of up-to-date videos and articles on his
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com >substack</a>
(and do read his article <a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com/about >

<h2>The Cradle</h2>
<a href =
https://thecradle.co/articles/uk-police-arrest-journalist-richard-medhurst-under-terrorism-act
>This article</a> states
<blockquote>
<p>
On 16 August [2024], Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta permanently
banned <i>The Cradle</i> from its social media platforms for allegedly violating
community guidelines by "praising terrorist organizations" and engaging in
"incitement to violence."
</p> <p>
"No one can see or find your account, and you can't use it. All your
information will be permanently deleted," reads the message accompanying
the ban on Instagram, where <i>The Cradle</i> had surpassed 107,000 followers
and amassed millions of views.
</p>
</blockquote>
So obviously the Streisand Effect reading recommendation here is <a href =
https://thecradle.co >The Cradle</a>.

<h2>Bassem Youssef</h2>
The same <a href =
https://thecradle.co/articles/uk-police-arrest-journalist-richard-medhurst-under-terrorism-act
>Cradle article</a> also says 
<blockquote>
On 20 August, Elon Musk banned popular Egyptian comedian Bassem Yousef's
account on X.
</blockquote>
Here are some interview on Youtube, Bassem Yousef with Piers Morgan 
<ul> <li>

<h2>Facebook</h2>
<a href = https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c786wlxz4jgo >
Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets 
to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war</a>.

Apparently the BBC examined 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations
but the article named only three:
<ul> <li>
<a href = http://www.palestinetv.ps/ >Palestine TV</a>
(though at the time of writing, this link seems to be broken;
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/@TV.Free.Palestine >this link</a>
<i>may</i> be to the same organisation
</li> <li>
<a href = https://english.wafa.ps/ >Wafa news agency</a>
</li> <li>
<a href = https://www.watanserb.com/en/ >Palestinian Wattan News</a>
</li> </ul>
