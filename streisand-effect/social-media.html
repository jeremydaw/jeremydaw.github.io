  <H1>Social media censorship</H1>
<p>
Here we list cases where social media platforms
"de-platform" particular contributors on
account of the political views expressed, and delete their articles,
or restrict visibility of some articles/videos.
Also where payment processors refuse to process payments for particular content
creators, for similar reasons.
</p> <p>
Human Rights Watch has produced a report <a href =

>Meta’s Broken Promises:
Systemic Censorship of Palestine Content on Instagram and Facebook</a>.

<h2>Scott Ritter</h2>
<p>
In <a href = https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test
>this article</a> referring to his two-part documentary, "Agent Zelensky"
he says
<blockquote>
YouTube deplatformed the documentary, demonetized my account, and
eventually banned me from the platform altogether.
</blockquote>
This documentary is described
<a href =
https://silentpartner.substack.com/p/agent-zelensky-parts-1-and-2
>here,</a>
<a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/agent-zelensky-part-1

and <a href =

and is available on Rumble

>here</a> and
<a href =
https://rumble.com/v30nd8w-a-scott-ritter-investigation-agent-zelensky-part-2.html
>here</a>.
</p> <p>
June 2025: I guess he is no longer "banned from [YouTube] altogether",
sinc he says that he posted something else - which has been taken down by
YouTube: <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-us-russia-summit-that-youtube
>The US-Russia Summit that YouTube doesn't want you to know about</a>
</p>

<h2>Chris Hedges</h2>
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/on-being-disappeared >
He writes</a>
<blockquote> <p>
The entire archive of On Contact, the Emmy-nominated show I hosted for six
years for RT America and RT International, has been disappeared from YouTube...
</p> <p>
I was on RT because, as a critic of US imperialism, militarism, the
corporate control of the two ruling parties, and especially because I
support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel,
I was blacklisted.  I was on RT for the same reason the dissident Vaclav
Havel, who I knew, was on Voice of America during the communist regime
in Czechoslovakia. It was that or not be heard. Havel had no more love
for the policies of Washington than I have for those of Moscow.
</p> <p>
What were my sins? I did not, like my former employer, The New York
Times, sell you the lie of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, peddle
conspiracy theories about Donald Trump being a Russian asset, put out a
ten-part podcast called the Caliphate that was a hoax, or tell you that
the contents on Hunter Biden’s laptop was “disinformation.”
</p> </blockquote>
<p>
In fact an <a href = https://www.rt.com/shows/on-contact/ >
archive of the On Contact shows</a> seems to be available on rt.com,
but only up to February 2022 (shortly before the article linked above
appeared). Then there is also a <a href =
https://www.youtube.com/@chrishedges7414/videos >Youtube channel</a>
currently available which apparently contains episodes from 7 and 8 years ago.
</p> <p>
Meanwhile, he has lots of up-to-date videos and articles on his
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com >substack</a>
(and do read his article <a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com/about >
Why subscribe?</a>).
</p> <p>
UPDATE June 2025: he has written a book <a href =
https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4716-a-genocide-foretold >A Genocide
Foretold: Reporting on Survival and Resistance in Occupied Palestine</a>
</p>

<h2>The Cradle - Meta</h2>
<a href =
https://thecradle.co/articles/uk-police-arrest-journalist-richard-medhurst-under-terrorism-act
>This article</a> states
<blockquote>
<p>
On 16 August [2024], Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta permanently
banned <i>The Cradle</i> from its social media platforms for allegedly violating
community guidelines by "praising terrorist organizations" and engaging in
"incitement to violence."
</p> <p>
"No one can see or find your account, and you can't use it. All your
information will be permanently deleted," reads the message accompanying
the ban on Instagram, where <i>The Cradle</i> had surpassed 107,000 followers
and amassed millions of views.
</p>
</blockquote>
And <a href = https://thecradle.co/articles-id/26473 >this article</a>
also discusses this, and has more about censorship by Meta.
So obviously the Streisand Effect reading recommendation here is
<a href = https://thecradle.co >The Cradle</a>.

<h2>Bassem Youssef</h2>
The same <a href =
https://thecradle.co/articles/uk-police-arrest-journalist-richard-medhurst-under-terrorism-act
>Cradle article</a> also says 
<blockquote>
On 20 August, Elon Musk banned popular Egyptian comedian Bassem Yousef's
account on X.
</blockquote>
Here are some interview on Youtube, Bassem Yousef with Piers Morgan 
<ul> <li>
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4idQbwsvtUo

<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p> <a href =
https://evolvepolitics.com/how-facebook-quietly-destroyed-the-threat-of-alternative-media-including-evolve-politics/
>How Facebook quietly destroyed the threat of Alternative Media -
including Evolve Politics</a>.
The article says that Facebook
"wants as little politics on Facebook as possible", but also that
"left-wing outlets ... appear to have been hardest hit".
Evolve Politics is <a href = https://evolvepolitics.com/ >here</a> and
<a href = https://evolvepolitics.substack.com/ >here</a>.
</p> <p>
<a href = https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c786wlxz4jgo >
Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets 
to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war</a>.

Apparently the BBC examined 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations
but the article named only three:
<ul> <li>
<a href = http://www.palestinetv.ps/ >Palestine TV</a>
(though at the time of writing, this link seems to be broken;
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/@TV.Free.Palestine >this link</a>
<i>may</i> be to the same organisation)
</li> <li>
<a href = https://english.wafa.ps/ >Wafa news agency</a>
</li> <li>
<a href = https://www.watanserb.com/en/ >Palestinian Wattan News</a>
</li> </ul>
</p>

<h2>Indrajit Samarajiva</h2>
He describes 
<a href = https://indi.ca/untitled-19/ >
How I Was Demonetized By Medium</a>
from October 2023, saying 
<blockquote>
I'm getting the message loud and clear.  STFU about Palestine.
</blockquote>
He writes in more detail here, 
<a href = https://indi.ca/why-i-left-medium-they-defenestrated-me/ >
Why I Left Medium (They Defenestrated Me)</a>
Amazingly (as he is based in Sri Lanka)
<blockquote>
FBI agents came to my sisters place of work looking for me
</blockquote>
He now writes on his own website, 
<a href = https://indi.ca/ >https://indi.ca/</a>.
Highly recommended.

<h2>Owen Jones</h2>
<p>
He writes <a href =
https://www.owenjones.news/p/ive-been-suspended-by-instagram
>I've been suspended by Instagram</a>.
Apparently they give him the right to appeal, but this right is meaningless
since they don't say why, except in a totally non-specific way (ie,
not following Community Standards on dangerous organisations and individuals).
</p> <p>
Whether or not he has violated any reasonable community standards
(and from what I've read or viewed of his work I think it unlikely),
it is quite wrong that an organisation with such power should be so 
unaccountable and (effectively) beyond challenge.  And it is those who
use Instagram - and other Meta products - who give it that power.  
So, don't use them!
</p> <p>
He says "Substack is one of the few places that’s likely not to suddenly
silence progressive voices": I hope that is true.
Anyhow, let me recommend
<a href = https://www.owenjones.news/ > his own Substack channel</a> 
and <a href = https://www.youtube.com/@OwenJonesTalks >his YouTube videos</a>.
</p> <p>
[May 2025] Along the same lines, he has written <a href =
https://www.owenjones.news/p/meta-censored-me-over-palestine-again
>Meta censored me over Palestine. Again.</a>
</p>

<h2>Google "censorship"</h2>
<a href = https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/08/02/pers-a02.html >
Google’s new search protocol is restricting access to 13 leading socialist,
progressive and anti-war web sites</a>.
This rather old article lists web sites which have suffered from a change
in Google’s search protocol.
As well as a recommendation to look at these sites, this is a recommendation
to use a search engine other than Google.

<h2>Miral Askar</h2>

<h2><a href = https://alonmizrahi.substack.com/ >Alon Mizrahi</a></h2>
who writes
<a href = https://substack.com/@alonmizrahi/note/c-139815300 >here</a>
<blockquote>
YouTube - a media platform owned by a Zionist Ashkenazi Jew -
is deleting my content on a regular basis now.
<br>...<br>
Still, you are not allowed to condemn Zionism on YouTube,
or basically almost anywhere else in the West, even if you're Jewish.
</blockquote>
It seems he wrote this in relation in particular to this video: <a href =

>Zionism is a crime against humanity</a>

<h2><a href = https://tonygreenstein.com/ >Tony Greenstein</a></h2>,

</a>, in an article which describes other instances also.

<h2>Lee Camp</h2>
<p>
He says
<blockquote>
My YouTube channel was banned. My TikTok was banned. My podcast on
Spotify was banned. All for bringing you the truth. I hope you’ll support
my work by subscribing
</blockquote>
that is, to his <a href = https://realleecamp.substack.com/ >substack</a>

<h2>Another Angry Voice</h2>
This writer, Thomas Clark, it would appear, formerly used blogspot,
but this link <a href = https://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.com/ >
https://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.com/</a> points to an article of
1 February 2025 where he describes how his readership
"has been tuned down so much ... 
which equates to a 90%+ collapse in visibility since 2017"
thanks to the Facebook algorithm.  Consequently he has started
<a href = https://anotherangryvoice.substack.com/ >a new AAV Substack</a>

<h2>Unforgiven Archives - Instagram</h2>

<h2>David Rovics</h2>

YouTube, aka The Biggest Platform on Earth, Has Deleted All My Albums</a>,
archived <a href = https://archive.vn/fzEhd >here</a>:
this appears to be because of his writing/singing about Gaza and the Houthis in
Yemen. He has a website
<a href = https://www.davidrovics.com/ > www.davidrovics.com </a>
</p> <p>
On substack he has several articles about YouTube blacklisting him and others:
<ul> <li> <a href =

</p>

<h2>Elon Musk - X</h2>
<a href =
https://www.sott.net/article/504265-Israel-is-where-Musks-free-speech-meets-its-limit
>Israel is where Musk's free speech meets its limit</a>:
"Recent revelations by Grok suggest anti-Zionist content
is being massively suppressed." (also <a href =
https://www.rt.com/news/631524-grok-x-israel-censorship/ >here</a>).
The article contains links to a sample of "anti-Zionist" articles.

<h2>TikTok</h2>
<a href = https://the307.substack.com/p/how-israel-took-over-tik-tok >
How Israel Took Over Tik Tok</a>,
archived <a href = https://archive.vn/CS9R0 >here</a>.
This sort of thing has always been a problem, of course, even in the case
of print newspapers.
Anyway, here it's sort of the Streisand Effect in reverse - 
a particular warning not to get your news or political outlook from what 
TikTok feeds you.

<h2>Fund-raising platforms</h2>
<p>
A related topic - not really social media - but anyway, here goes.
</p> <p>
<a href = https://www.mintpressnews.com/ >MintPress News</a>
has said that a fund-raising platform,
"Indiegogo has cancelled our campaign and will not provide us with
our $50,000 payout" which was raised through the platform.
They also say "we were also recently banned from GoFundMe and Paypal"
(though they don't say whether those platforms collected money for
MintPress News and then refused to pay it out).
See <a href =
https://mailchi.mp/mintpressnews/lowkey-keep-mintpress-alive-1526009
>their email here</a>.
</p> <p>
So obviously in this case the Streisand Effect reading recommendation is
<a href = https://www.mintpressnews.com/ >MintPress News</a>
</p>
