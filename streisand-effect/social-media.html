  <H1>Social media censorship</H1>
<p>
Here we list cases where social media platforms
"de-platform" particular contributors on
account of the political views expressed, and delete their articles,
or restrict visibility of some articles/videos.
Also where payment processors refuse to process payments for particular content
creators, for similar reasons.
</p> <p>
Human Rights Watch has produced a report <a href =
https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and
>Meta’s Broken Promises:
Systemic Censorship of Palestine Content on Instagram and Facebook</a>.
</p> <p>
On a similar theme, read <a href =
https://karat.substack.com/p/the-silent-shaping-of-your-reality
>The Silent Shaping of Your Reality</a>.
I think this is a very important article, and also an earlier one
by the same author, <a href =

>Cognitive Warfare</a>
</p>

<h2>Scott Ritter</h2>
<p>
In <a href = https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-trump-litmus-test
>this article</a> referring to his two-part documentary, "Agent Zelensky"
he says
<blockquote>
YouTube deplatformed the documentary, demonetized my account, and
eventually banned me from the platform altogether.
</blockquote>
This documentary is described
<a href =
https://silentpartner.substack.com/p/agent-zelensky-parts-1-and-2
>here,</a>
<a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/agent-zelensky-part-1
>here,</a>
and <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/a-scott-ritter-investigation-agent
>here,</a>
and is available on Rumble
<a href =

>here</a> and
<a href =
https://rumble.com/v30nd8w-a-scott-ritter-investigation-agent-zelensky-part-2.html
>here</a>.
</p> <p>
June 2025: I guess he is no longer "banned from [YouTube] altogether",
sinc he says that he posted something else - which has been taken down by
YouTube: <a href =
https://scottritter.substack.com/p/the-us-russia-summit-that-youtube
>The US-Russia Summit that YouTube doesn't want you to know about</a>
</p>

<h2>Chris Hedges</h2>
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/on-being-disappeared >
He writes</a>
<blockquote> <p>
The entire archive of On Contact, the Emmy-nominated show I hosted for six
years for RT America and RT International, has been disappeared from YouTube...
</p> <p>
I was on RT because, as a critic of US imperialism, militarism, the
corporate control of the two ruling parties, and especially because I
support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel,
I was blacklisted.  I was on RT for the same reason the dissident Vaclav
Havel, who I knew, was on Voice of America during the communist regime
in Czechoslovakia. It was that or not be heard. Havel had no more love
for the policies of Washington than I have for those of Moscow.
</p> <p>
What were my sins? I did not, like my former employer, The New York
Times, sell you the lie of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, peddle
conspiracy theories about Donald Trump being a Russian asset, put out a
ten-part podcast called the Caliphate that was a hoax, or tell you that
the contents on Hunter Biden’s laptop was “disinformation.”
</p> </blockquote>
<p>
In fact an <a href = https://www.rt.com/shows/on-contact/ >
archive of the On Contact shows</a> seems to be available on rt.com,
but only up to February 2022 (shortly before the article linked above
appeared). Then there is also a <a href =
https://www.youtube.com/@chrishedges7414/videos >Youtube channel</a>
currently available which apparently contains episodes from 7 and 8 years ago.
</p> <p>
Meanwhile, he has lots of up-to-date videos and articles on his
<a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com >substack</a>
(and do read his article <a href = https://chrishedges.substack.com/about >
Why subscribe?</a>).
</p> <p>
UPDATE June 2025: he has written a book <a href =
https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4716-a-genocide-foretold >A Genocide
Foretold: Reporting on Survival and Resistance in Occupied Palestine</a>
</p>

<h2>The Cradle</h2>
<a href =
https://thecradle.co/articles/uk-police-arrest-journalist-richard-medhurst-under-terrorism-act
>This article</a> states
<blockquote>
<p>
On 16 August [2024], Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta permanently
banned <i>The Cradle</i> from its social media platforms for allegedly violating
community guidelines by "praising terrorist organizations" and engaging in
"incitement to violence."
</p> <p>
"No one can see or find your account, and you can't use it. All your
information will be permanently deleted," reads the message accompanying
the ban on Instagram, where <i>The Cradle</i> had surpassed 107,000 followers
and amassed millions of views.
</p>
</blockquote>
So obviously the Streisand Effect reading recommendation here is
<a href = https://thecradle.co >The Cradle</a>.

<h2>Bassem Youssef</h2>
The same <a href =
https://thecradle.co/articles/uk-police-arrest-journalist-richard-medhurst-under-terrorism-act
>Cradle article</a> also says 
<blockquote>
On 20 August, Elon Musk banned popular Egyptian comedian Bassem Yousef's
account on X.
</blockquote>
Here are some interview on Youtube, Bassem Yousef with Piers Morgan 
<ul> <li>
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4idQbwsvtUo
>Israel-Hamas War: Piers Morgan vs Bassem Youssef On Palestine's Treatment</a>

</li> </ul>

<h2>Facebook</h2>
<a href = https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c786wlxz4jgo >
Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets 
to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war</a>.
<!-- also

-->
Apparently the BBC examined 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations
but the article named only three:
<ul> <li>
<a href = http://www.palestinetv.ps/ >Palestine TV</a>
(though at the time of writing, this link seems to be broken;
<a href = https://www.youtube.com/@TV.Free.Palestine >this link</a>
<i>may</i> be to the same organisation)
</li> <li>
<a href = https://english.wafa.ps/ >Wafa news agency</a>
</li> <li>
<a href = https://www.watanserb.com/en/ >Palestinian Wattan News</a>
</li> </ul>

<h2>Indrajit Samarajiva</h2>
He describes 
<a href = https://indi.ca/untitled-19/ >
How I Was Demonetized By Medium</a>
from October 2023, saying 
<blockquote>
I'm getting the message loud and clear.  STFU about Palestine.
</blockquote>
He writes in more detail here, 
<a href = https://indi.ca/why-i-left-medium-they-defenestrated-me/ >
Why I Left Medium (They Defenestrated Me)</a>
Amazingly (as he is based in Sri Lanka)
<blockquote>
FBI agents came to my sisters place of work looking for me
</blockquote>
He now writes on his own website, 
<a href = https://indi.ca/ >https://indi.ca/</a>.
Highly recommended.

<h2>Owen Jones</h2>
<p>
He writes <a href =
https://www.owenjones.news/p/ive-been-suspended-by-instagram
>I've been suspended by Instagram</a>.
Apparently they give him the right to appeal, but this right is meaningless
since they don't say why, except in a totally non-specific way (ie,
not following Community Standards on dangerous organisations and individuals).
</p> <p>
Whether or not he has violated any reasonable community standards
(and from what I've read or viewed of his work I think it unlikely),
it is quite wrong that an organisation with such power should be so 
unaccountable and (effectively) beyond challenge.  And it is those who
use Instagram - and other Meta products - who give it that power.  
So, don't use them!
</p> <p>
He says "Substack is one of the few places that’s likely not to suddenly
silence progressive voices": I hope that is true.
Anyhow, let me recommend
<a href = https://www.owenjones.news/ > his own Substack channel</a> 
and <a href = https://www.youtube.com/@OwenJonesTalks >his YouTube videos</a>.
</p> <p>
[May 2025] Along the same lines, he has written <a href =
https://www.owenjones.news/p/meta-censored-me-over-palestine-again
>Meta censored me over Palestine. Again.</a>
</p>

<h2>Google "censorship"</h2>
<a href = https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/08/02/pers-a02.html >
Google’s new search protocol is restricting access to 13 leading socialist,
progressive and anti-war web sites</a>.
This rather old article lists web sites which have suffered from a change
in Google’s search protocol.
As well as a recommendation to look at these sites, this is a recommendation
to use a search engine other than Google.

<h2>Miral Askar</h2>
<a href = https://mirala.substack.com/p/the-post-that-got-me-banned-iran >
The Post That Got Me Banned: Iran, Israel, and the Nuclear Hypocrisy No One
Wants to Talk About</a>
And here is another interesting one from the same author:
<a href = https://mirala.substack.com/p/the-forgotten-scandal-how-israel >
The Forgotten Scandal: How Israel Stole Thousands of Children</a>

<h2><a href = https://alonmizrahi.substack.com/ >Alon Mizrahi</a></h2>
who writes
<a href = https://substack.com/@alonmizrahi/note/c-139815300 >here</a>
<blockquote>
YouTube - a media platform owned by a Zionist Ashkenazi Jew -
is deleting my content on a regular basis now.
<br>...<br>
Still, you are not allowed to condemn Zionism on YouTube,
or basically almost anywhere else in the West, even if you're Jewish.
</blockquote>
It seems he wrote this in relation in particular to this video: <a href =
https://alonmizrahi.substack.com/p/zionism-is-a-crime-against-humanity
>Zionism is a crime against humanity</a>

<h2><a href = https://tonygreenstein.com/ >Tony Greenstein</a></h2>,
also <a href = https://azvsas.blogspot.com/ >here</a>,
who writes <a href = https://archive.vn/xrKRj >
Racist PayPal has Removed My Account of 15 Years Without Any Warning Whatsoever
</a>, in an article which describes other instances also.
