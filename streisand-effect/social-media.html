  <H1>Social media censorship</H1>
Here we list cases where social media platforms
"de-platform" particular contributors on
account of the political views expressed, and delete their articles,
or restrict visibility of some articles/videos.
Also where payment processors refuse to process payments for particular content
creators, for similar reasons.

YouTube deplatformed the documentary, demonetized my account, and
eventually banned me from the platform altogether.
