  <H1>The Streisand Effect</H1>

  <H2>What is the Streisand Effect?</H2>
    <P> Described
    <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect >here</a>
    <blockquote>
    The <b>Streisand effect</b> is an unintended consequence
    of attempts to hide, remove, or censor information,
    where the effort instead increases public awareness of the information.
    </blockquote>
    The name came about when the famous actress sued (unsuccessfully)
    to have a photograph of her house removed from the internet. But it
    <blockquote>
    had been downloaded only six times prior to Streisand's lawsuit,
    two of those being by Streisand's attorneys. Public awareness
    of the case led to more than 420,000 people visiting the site over
    the following month.
    </blockquote>

  <H2>What is this site about?</H2>
  <p>
  Well, I've observed that even when attempts to punish or suppress
  particular writings are well reported, there is often no link to the
  writings themselves.
</p>
  <p>
  These pages aim to provide those links, with the aim of increasing the
  readership of those sites or writings. The goal of this is to make
  the punishment or attempted suppression of such writing ineffective and
  counterproductive. And hopefully to deter such punishment or suppression.
</p>

  <H2>Why now?</H2>
  <p>
  Well, I've had this idea for some time, was spurred on to action when 
  one day I got about five emails with articles about the police action against
  <a href = ./asa-winstanley.html >Asa Winstanley</a>.
  So he is the first writer whose work I want to support and publicise.
</p>
  <p>
I'll probably put this stuff on substack or somewhere similar,
if and when I work out how to use it effectively.  
Meanwhile I do seem to have succeeded in setting up something at
<a href = https://streisandeffect.substack.com/ >
https://streisandeffect.substack.com/</a>,
and an email address streisandeffect@substack.com
</p>
<p>
So what is intended to follow here is an expanding list of references
to particular cases, with their consequent reading recommendations.
</p>

  <H2>Particular cases or categories</H2>
  <h3>Asa Winstanley</h3>
  Read more <a href = ./asa-winstanley.html >here</a></h3>.
  Writer about Palestine etc, investigated for terrorism, involving a dawn 
  police raid on his home, and confiscation of his electronic devices.
Read his writing on his substack
<a href = https://asawinstanley.substack.com/ >Palestine is Still the
Issue</a> or at the
