  <H1>Jamison-Capital Bridge @ The Henry</H1>

Two bridge clubs in the Belconnen area of Canberra are joining forces
to assist in the establishment of a social bridge activity at 
    <a href = https://www.thehenry.com.au >The Henry, Higgins</a>,
    94 Fullagar Cres, Higgins, ACT
    <p>
    This would be held on Mondays, 12:30 - 15:30 except public holidays,
    in the media rooom at The Henry.
    <p>
    We aim that it should commence on 21 August 2023
    (but this may be subject to change).
    <p>Table fees are projected to be $5.00 cash or by token (5 tokens for $20)
    <p>We would play duplicate bridge, with a session director, 
    using pre-dealt hands, with hand records available,
    and with scores calculated and published,
    but we won't be affiliated to the ABF or BFACT (so no masterpoints).
